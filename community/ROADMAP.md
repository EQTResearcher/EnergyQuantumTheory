# EQT-Research Project Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plan for the Energy Quantum Theory (EQT) community. It is a living document that will be continuously adjusted as the project evolves and based on community feedback.

## Our Development Principles

- **Value-Driven**: Each phase must deliver concrete outcomes that tangibly demonstrate EQT's explanatory power.
- **Community-Built**: Every task on the roadmap is open to global contributors.
- **Open & Transparent**: All progress, code, and data will be open to the community.
- **AI-Augmented**: Proactively leverage modern AI tools to enhance research efficiency while ensuring rigor.

## üéØ Overall Vision

To systematically validate the explanatory and predictive capabilities of EQT through open collaboration and computational simulations, aiming for it to become a serious scientific theory widely discussed and examined by mainstream physics within 20-30 years.

## üó∫Ô∏è Phased Roadmap

### Phase 1: Beacon Construction (2025 - 2026)

**Goal**: Create a stunning "cognitive beacon" to attract the first core contributors, allowing any visitor to intuitively grasp EQT's framework and potential within 10 minutes.

**Core Deliverable**: EQT-Explorer (Interactive Platform)  
A web-based application integrating the following core modules:

| Module | Description | Key Tasks / Metrics |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Dynamic Equations Sandbox | Allows users to adjust parameters ($k$, $D$, $\mathbf{v}$, $S$) and observe the structure formation and evolution of the energy quantum field $\rho_\nu$ in 1D/2D in real-time. | - Implement a basic numerical solver.<br>- Provide 3-5 preset scenarios (e.g., structure formation, wave packet diffusion).<br>- **Metric**: > 5,000 unique website visitors. |
| Frequency Universe Map | An interactive "periodic table" visually categorizing particles/phenomena within the EQT frequency framework and displaying their basic properties. | - Complete entries for at least 20 key particles/phenomena (e.g., photon, electron, Higgs boson, gravitational waves).<br>- **Metric**: Becomes a "calling card" shared outside the community. |
| Thought Experiment Gallery | Uses animations and visualizations to explain how EQT reinterprets classic thought experiments like the double-slit experiment and quantum entanglement. | - Complete 2-3 high-quality visualized thought experiment cases. |

**Community & Ecosystem Goals**:
- Reach 500 GitHub Stars and 50 active contributors.
- Establish a stable contribution pipeline from `good-first-issue` to Pull Request.
- Build initial project visibility by sharing platform content on platforms like X.

### Phase 2: Deep Validation (2027 - 2029)

**Goal**: Transition from "demonstration" to "validation," performing reproducible, quantitative analyses for 1-2 specific physical phenomena that can be compared with mainstream models.

**Core Deliverable**: EQT-Validation-Papers (Whitepapers & Code)

| Project | Description | Key Tasks / Metrics |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| EQT Interpretation of CMB Power Spectrum | Use the dynamic equations and their fluctuations within the EQT framework to perform qualitative, and potentially quantitative, fitting of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation power spectrum. | - Publish reproducible Jupyter Notebooks and full code.<br>- Release a technical report: "EQT & CMB: A Preliminary Comparative Analysis."<br>- **Metric**: Spark discussion outside the community; be cited or commented on by researchers in relevant fields. |
| Alternative Model for Galaxy Rotation Curves | Explore whether EQT's force law $\mathbf{F} \propto -\nabla \langle \rho_\nu \rangle$ can explain specific types of galaxy rotation curves without requiring dark matter. | - Select public data for 1-2 typical galaxies (e.g., NGC 3198).<br>- Build corresponding EQT models and perform fitting.<br>- **Metric**: Open-source the complete data, code, and analysis process as a verifiable research case. |
| EQT Core Toolkit v0.5 | Build a foundational Python library encapsulating common EQT calculations (e.g., dynamic equation solvers, resonance strength calculations). | - Release the first test version of the `eqt-core` PyPI package.<br>- Include complete API documentation and examples. |

**Community & Ecosystem Goals**:
- Expand the community to 200+ contributors.
- Publish 1-2 preprints on ArXiv with community co-authorship, based on phase outcomes.
- Host the first online EQT Community Symposium.

### Phase 3: Paradigm Expansion (2030 - 2032)

**Goal**: Expand EQT's application to new domains and initiate small-scale, collaborative experimental validation projects.

**Core Deliverable**: EQT-Beyond-Cosmology (Cross-Domain Applications)

| Project | Description | Key Tasks / Metrics |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| EQT Perspective on Condensed Matter Systems | Explore potential applications of EQT in explaining certain condensed matter phenomena (e.g., superconductivity, topological insulators), even if only conceptual initially. | - Publish a review report: "EQT & Condensed Matter Physics: Potential Intersections."<br>- Develop 1-2 concrete, computable research proposals. |
| Tabletop Experiment Proposals | Design 1-2 low-cost, tabletop experiments feasible in university labs to test certain unique predictions of EQT (e.g., novel resonances at specific frequencies). | - Publish a detailed "EQT Tabletop Experiment Guidebook."<br>- **Metric**: Establish collaboration with a university research group and initiate an experiment. |
| EQT Toolkit v1.0 | The toolkit's features stabilize and integrate common data analysis and visualization modules. | - Release the official v1.0 version.<br>- Be referenced or used by external projects. |

**Community & Ecosystem Goals**:
- Form more specialized sub-teams (Theory, Simulation, Experiment).
- Launch the "EQT Exploration Fund" to finance outstanding community proposals.

## üîÆ Long-Term Outlook (2033+)

- **Education Integration**: Compile an "Introduction to EQT" textbook and offer specialized courses at partner institutions.
- **Major Experiments**: Promote larger-scale experimental collaboration projects based on solid prior results.
- **Theoretical Deepening**: Continuously refine EQT's mathematical foundations and address potential internal logical consistency challenges.
