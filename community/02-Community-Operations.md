# EQT-Research Community Operations

## Overview

The Energy Quantum Theory (EQT) community is an internet-based, openly collaborative physics research project. We are committed to building a decentralized global collaboration network to collectively validate and develop the Energy Quantum Theory.

The core theoretical foundations of EQT include:

- Planck's Formula: $E = h\nu$
- Energy Quantum Density Field: $\rho_\nu(\mathbf{r}, t)$
- Force Definition: $\mathbf{F} \propto -\nabla \langle \rho_\nu \rangle$
- Dynamic Equation: $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = k \rho^2 - D \nabla^2 \rho - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) + S$
- Cosmic Frequency Sequencing: (< $10^{20}$ Hz, $10^{20}â€“10^{24}$ Hz, > $10^{24}$ Hz)

The community is organized via open platforms like GitHub and actively embraces modern AI toolchains, aiming to enhance the efficiency of theoretical derivation, computational simulation, and experimental design, thereby accelerating the scientific validation process of EQT.

## Goals

- **Openness**: Provide low-barrier entry paths; all research processes and outcomes are open to community members.
- **Collaboration**: Integrate the intelligence and resources of global members through distributed task decomposition and integration.
- **AI-Augmentation**: Utilize AI as an enabling tool to enhance research efficiency, assisting researchers with procedural work.
- **Scientific Validation**: Promote the recognition of EQT by the scientific community through reproducible theoretical calculations and experiments.

## Organizational Structure

The community adopts a contribution-based open governance model.

1. **Participants**: Any researcher, student, or enthusiast interested in EQT.
2. **Contributors**: Participants who make substantive contributions to the project by submitting code, documentation, data, or designing experiments.
3. **Maintainers**: A team comprised of core contributors responsible for the project's daily operations, quality review, and development planning.
4. **Advisory Board (Planned)**: In the future, senior scholars will be invited to provide academic guidance, ensuring the scientific soundness of the research direction.

## Communication & Collaboration Platforms

We employ a distributed communication system tailored to different scenarios:

- **GitHub**: Serves as the core collaboration platform, hosting all code, documentation, data, and facilitating asynchronous technical discussions via Issues and Pull Requests.
- **Discord / Forums**: Serves as the primary discussion hub for daily academic exchange, idea brainstorming, and quick Q&A.
- **Social Media (e.g., X)**: Serves as an external distribution channel for disseminating project progress, sharing insights, and attracting new participants.
- **Regular Online Seminars**: Serves as a supplement for in-depth synchronous communication, organized by the community to share major progress or hold thematic discussions.

**Principle**: All valuable conclusions generated in synchronous communication should ultimately be documented in GitHub Issues or documentation to ensure knowledge traceability and openness.

## Workflow

1. **Explore & Discover**
   - New members can learn the EQT basics and project structure via the project `README.md` and the `docs/` directory.
   - Find an entry point of interest by browsing `good-first-issues.md` and the project `ROADMAP.md`.
2. **Task Claiming & Collaboration**
   - Members claim tasks in GitHub Issues or initiate new discussions.
   - Exploration and development in personal or team repositories are encouraged, with mature work contributed to the main project via Pull Requests.
3. **Contribution & Integration**
   - All forms of contributions are submitted via GitHub Pull Requests.
   - The PR description should clearly explain the contribution, design rationale, and its relationship to existing work.
4. **Review & Merge**
   - The Maintainer team is responsible for reviewing PRs to ensure scientific soundness, code quality, and adherence to standards.
   - A "Squash and Merge" strategy is used to maintain a clean main branch history, and associated Issues are closed upon merge.

## AI-Augmented Research Paradigm

We encourage the community to explore and practice an AI-augmented research model:

- **Concept Visualization**: Use multimodal AI to generate visual sketches of theoretical concepts and mathematical formulas to aid intuitive thinking.
- **Code-Assisted Development**: Use AI programming assistants to handle basic code scaffolding, unit tests, and docstring writing, allowing researchers to focus on core logic.
- **Literature & Data Intelligence**: Use AI tools for rapid literature summarization, structured data extraction, or generating preliminary analysis reports.
- **Inspiration & Exploration**: Engage in open-ended dialogue with AI to challenge assumptions, spark new research ideas, or discover overlooked connections.

**Core Principle**: AI is a powerful auxiliary tool but cannot replace the researcher's critical thinking and academic judgment. All content generated or assisted by AI must undergo rigorous, manual academic review and validation. The contributor bears ultimate responsibility for its accuracy.

## Intellectual Property & Open Licensing

To protect the community's openness and contributors' rights, the project adopts the following licenses:

## Promotion & Incentives

- **Contribution Recognition**: All contributors will be permanently recorded in the project's contributor list. Contributors to major project modules may receive corresponding attribution rights.
- **Result Dissemination**: Project progress, major breakthroughs, and exemplary contributions will be promoted through community channels.
- **Virtual Honors**: Establish a fun achievement badge system to recognize members' contributions in theoretical research, code engineering, community collaboration, etc.
