## ðŸš€ Good First Issues List

### Type 1: Documentation & Content Improvement

These tasks help you familiarize yourself with EQT's theoretical foundations and project structure.

| Task Title | Brief Description | Skills Required | Related Files/Links |
|------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| [Docs] Fix typos in `docs/theory/fundamentals.md` | Read through the basic theory document and fix typos, grammatical errors, or formatting issues. | Attention to detail, Markdown | `docs/theory/fundamentals.md` |
| [Docs] Add comments to code examples | Add clear code comments and docstrings to one of the Python scripts (e.g., `basic_simulation.py`) in the `code/simulations/` directory. | Basic Python | `code/simulations/` |
| [Docs] Translate a section of theory documentation | Translate a small section (~300-500 words) in `docs/theory/` from Chinese to English, or vice versa. | Bilingual proficiency | `docs/theory/` |
| [Content] Create a visual sketch for core EQT formulas | Use your preferred tool (e.g., Python Matplotlib, Manim, or even a hand-drawn photo) to create an intuitive diagram for $E = h\nu$ or the dynamic equations. | Creativity, Basic Visualization | [Issue: #1](https://github.com/EQT-Research/EnergyQuantumTheory/issues/1) |

### Type 2: Code & Data Tasks

These tasks involve simple programming and data manipulation, suitable for contributors with some technical background.

| Task Title | Brief Description | Skills Required | Related Files/Links |
|------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| [Code] Write a unit test for an existing function | Write a simple unit test (using pytest) for a utility function (e.g., `calculate_energy(frequency)`) in the `code/utils/` directory. | Basic Python, Unit Testing | `code/utils/` |
| [Code] Create a 1D dynamic equation demo script | Write a simple Python script using NumPy and Matplotlib to demonstrate the evolution of the dynamic equations in a 1D case (you can fix most parameters). | Basic Python, NumPy, Matplotlib | [Issue: #2](https://github.com/EQT-Research/EnergyQuantumTheory/issues/2) |
| [Data] Organize and format a sample dataset | We have a raw CSV data file `data/raw_sample_data.csv`. Please clean and format it into a standard CSV file and write a brief `README.md` describing the meaning of each column. | Attention to Detail, Data Processing | `data/` |
| [Tooling] Optimize Jupyter Notebook display | Optimize an existing Jupyter Notebook (in the `notebooks/` directory) by ensuring its outputs are cleared properly and adding a table of contents for navigation. | Jupyter Notebook | `notebooks/` |
