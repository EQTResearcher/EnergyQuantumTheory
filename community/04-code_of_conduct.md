# EQT-Research Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Conflict Resolution & Reporting

### 1. How to Report an Issue

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by one of the following methods:

- Email the core maintenance team at: conduct@eqt-research.org.
- Contact a maintainer on GitHub: Use GitHub's private messaging feature to contact one or more maintainers directly.

When reporting, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- Where the incident occurred (e.g., Discord channel, GitHub Issue)
- The time of the incident
- A description of the behavior
- The context surrounding the incident
- The individual(s) involved
- Other witnesses or relevant parties

The maintenance team is committed to maintaining confidentiality with respect to the reporter.

### 2. Enforcement Process

The maintenance team will follow this process for handling each report:

1. **Acknowledge & Understand**: The maintenance team will acknowledge receipt of the report and contact the reporter within 2 business days to understand the full scope of the incident.
2. **Investigation**: The team will conduct a necessary investigation. This may involve private, confidential communications with the parties involved.
3. **Assessment**: Based on the findings, the team will assess whether the behavior violates this Code of Conduct.
4. **Action**: If a violation is confirmed, the team will decide on and execute an appropriate corrective action. Actions will be proportional to the severity of the violation and may include:
   - A written warning
   - Temporary muting or suspension from community activities
   - A permanent ban
5. **Communication**: The enforcement decision will be communicated to the reporter and the reported individual, while respecting privacy and confidentiality.
6. **Appeal**: Parties involved may appeal the decision by requesting a review from the maintenance team within 7 days of receiving the decision.

## AI-Augmented Community Collaboration

We encourage the responsible use of AI tools to enhance collaborative efficiency, adhering to the following principles:

- **Accountability**: Contributors using AI tools to generate content (code, documentation, data) are ultimately responsible for that content and must rigorously verify and review it.
- **No Misuse**: AI tools must not be used to generate spam, conduct malicious automated interactions, or create unwelcoming comments.
- **Transparency**: Contributors are encouraged (though not required) to mention the assistance of AI tools in key steps within their contribution notes, for the sake of academic rigor.

## Recognition & Incentives

We are committed not only to addressing negative behavior but also to recognizing positive contributions. Members who consistently demonstrate the following qualities will receive community recognition:

- **Community Builders**: Those who actively help newcomers and foster an inclusive atmosphere.
- **Rigorous Reviewers**: Those who provide insightful, friendly, and constructive code/documentation reviews.
- **Collaboration Exemplars**: Those who maintain a focus on issues rather than persons in academic debates and help drive consensus.

Recognition may include public acknowledgment in the project's README.md, granting exclusive virtual badges, etc.
