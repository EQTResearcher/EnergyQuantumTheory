# Dynamic Equations of Energy Quanta Theory: Multi-Frequency Framework and Co-Frequency Resonance Mechanism

## 1. Multi-Frequency Form of the Dynamic Equations

The energy quanta density field $\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is inherently multi-frequency and can be expressed as the sum of its frequency components:

$$
\rho(\mathbf{r}, t) = \sum_f \rho_f(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

where $\rho_f$ represents the sub-density field of energy quanta with frequency $f$.

The dynamic equation under the multi-frequency framework is:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho_f}{\partial t} = k_f \rho_f^m - D_f \nabla^2 \rho_f - \nabla \cdot (\rho_f \mathbf{v}_f) + S_f
$$

**Physical meaning of each term**:
- $k_f$: Frequency-dependent positive feedback coefficient
- $D_f$: Frequency-dependent diffusion coefficient
- $\mathbf{v}_f$: Frequency-dependent velocity field
- $S_f$: Frequency-dependent source term

## 2. Mathematical Formulation of Co-Frequency Resonance Mechanism

Co-frequency resonance is achieved by modifying coupling coefficients. Define the frequency matching function:

$$
g(f, f_0) = \frac{A}{(f - f_0)^2 + \gamma^2}
$$

where:
- $f$: Energy quanta frequency
- $f_0$: Characteristic frequency of the target system
- $\gamma$: Resonance width, characterizing interaction specificity
- $A$: Coupling strength amplitude

**Dynamical equation terms modified by resonance**:

### 2.1 Resonance-modified positive feedback term

$$
k_f(\Delta f) = k_0 \cdot g(f, f_0) = \frac{k_0 A}{(f - f_0)^2 + \gamma^2}
$$

### 2.2 Resonance-modified force expression

$$
\mathbf{F}_f = -\beta(\Delta f) \nabla \rho_f = -\beta_0 g(f, f_0) \nabla \rho_f
$$

## 3. Physical Manifestations of Multi-Frequency Resonance

### 3.1 Resonance Characteristics of Fundamental Interactions

| Interaction       | Char. Freq $f_0$ (Hz) | Resonance Width $\gamma$ | Coupling Strength |
|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Strong Force      | $10^{23} - 10^{24}$  | Narrow ($\sim 10^{20}$) | Strong ($\sim 1$) |
| EM Force          | $10^{15} - 10^{20}$  | Medium ($\sim 10^{15}$) | Medium ($\sim 10^{-2}$) |
| Weak Force        | $10^{25} - 10^{26}$  | Wide ($\sim 10^{24}$)   | Weak ($\sim 10^{-5}$) |
| Gravity           | $10^{-1} - 10^{3}$   | Very Wide ($\sim 10^{10}$) | Very Weak ($\sim 10^{-39}$) |

### 3.2 Physical Consequences of Resonance Effects

- **Efficient energy transfer**: When $\Delta f = |f - f_0| \ll \gamma$, energy quanta resonate with the system, maximizing energy transfer efficiency.
- **Selective coupling**: Different particles interact strongly only with energy quanta in specific frequency bands.
- **Force range determination**: Resonance width affects the effective range of interactions.

## 4. Dynamic Evolution of Multi-Frequency Resonance

### 4.1 Frequency-dependent diffusion coefficient

$$
D_f = D_0 \cdot f^\alpha
$$

where $\alpha > 0$, indicating higher-frequency energy quanta diffuse faster.

### 4.2 Resonance-enhanced advection term

$$
\mathbf{v}_f = -\alpha_f \nabla \rho_f
$$

where $\alpha_f = \alpha_0 \cdot g(f, f_0)$, with convection effects significantly enhanced at resonance.

### 4.3 Frequency-selective source term

$$
S_f = S_0 \cdot \delta(f - f_s)
$$

indicating external perturbations inject energy only at specific frequency $f_s$.

## 5. Interaction Description in Unified Framework

### 5.1 Electromagnetic Interaction

$$
\frac{\partial \rho_{\text{EM}}}{\partial t} = k_{\text{EM}} g(f, f_{\text{atom}}) \rho_{\text{EM}}^2 - D_{\text{EM}} \nabla^2 \rho_{\text{EM}} + S_{\text{EM}}
$$

where $f_{\text{atom}} \sim 10^{15} \, \text{Hz}$, corresponding to atomic transition frequencies.

### 5.2 Gravitational Interaction

$$
\frac{\partial \rho_{\text{grav}}}{\partial t} = k_{\text{grav}} g(f, f_{\text{cosmo}}) \rho_{\text{grav}}^2 - D_{\text{grav}} \nabla^2 \rho_{\text{grav}}
$$

where $f_{\text{cosmo}} \sim 10^{-3} \, \text{Hz}$, corresponding to cosmological scale characteristic frequency.

## 6. Experimental Verification and Observational Implications

### 6.1 Testable Predictions

- **Resonance peak detection**: Enhanced interaction cross-sections should be observed near $f = f_0$.
- **Frequency selectivity**: Changing excitation frequency should cause Lorentzian-type variations in interaction strength.
- **Linewidth measurement**: Measuring $\gamma$ can verify the theory's microscopic mechanism.

### 6.2 New Understanding of Dark Matter

Dark matter may correspond to:

$$
f_{\text{DM}} \sim 10^{3} - 10^{10} \, \text{Hz}, \quad \gamma_{\text{DM}} \, \text{very large}
$$

resulting in weak resonant coupling with ordinary matter, but still exhibiting gravitational effects.

## 7. Theoretical Significance

1. **Unified interaction description**: Four fundamental forces unified as resonance phenomena in different frequency intervals.
2. **Micro-macro connection**: Natural connection between frequency selectivity in quantum processes and continuity of macroscopic forces.
3. **Computable framework**: Provides a path for calculating interaction strengths from first principles.
4. **Guidance for new physics**: Predicts possible new resonance modes at specific frequencies.

This framework elevates Energy Quanta Theory to a complete, quantitatively calculable, and experimentally testable theory, providing a new paradigm for understanding unified physical laws from elementary particles to cosmic structures.
