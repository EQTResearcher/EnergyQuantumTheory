## 1. Ontological Definition of Force

Within the framework of Energy Quanta Theory (EQT), force is defined as the coupled response of the energy quanta density field gradient acting upon mass quanta, mathematically expressed as:

F = -κ m ∇ρ

Where:

- `ρ(r, t)` is the energy quanta density field (Dimensions: `[Energy]/[Volume]`), characterizing the energy distribution of energy quanta per unit volume.
- `∇ρ` is the density field gradient (Dimensions: `[Energy]/[Volume·Length]`), pointing in the direction of increasing energy quanta density.
- `m` is the inertial mass of the subjected mass quantum.
- `κ` is the coupling coefficient (Dimensions: `[Length]³/[Time]²`), reflecting the interaction strength.

## 2. Mechanism of Force Generation

### 2.1 Dynamical Realization of the Energy Minimization Principle

The spatiotemporal evolution of the energy quanta density field obeys the generalized diffusion equation:

∂ρ/∂t = kρ² - D∇²ρ - ∇·(ρv) + S

Where:

- The `kρ²` term characterizes the positive feedback resulting from energy quanta interactions.
- The `D∇²ρ` term describes the diffusion process of energy quanta.
- The `∇·(ρv)` term is the convection term, with the velocity field `v ∝ -∇ρ`.
- The `S` term is the source term, corresponding to processes where mass quanta transform into energy quanta.

Force generation originates from the spontaneous process of the system tending towards energy minimization through the redistribution of energy quanta. The existence of a gradient `∇ρ` signifies a non-equilibrium state of the system, driving the energy quanta flux `J = -D∇ρ`, which in turn transmits momentum to mass quanta via the velocity field `v`.

### 2.2 Frequency-Spin Selection Rule

The coupling strength is modulated by the frequency-spin selection function:

g(f, s) = A(s) / [(f - f₀(s))² + γ(s)²]

Where:

- `f` is the energy quantum frequency.
- `s` is the spin quantum number of the mass quantum.
- `f₀(s)` is the resonance frequency.
- `A(s)` is the coupling strength.
- `γ(s)` is the resonance width.

The effective force expression is modified to:

F = -κ m ∑ⱼ [ g(fⱼ, s) · ∇ρⱼ ]

## 3. Unified Formulation of Fundamental Interactions

### 3.1 Gravitational Interaction

Arises from the density gradient of low-frequency gravitons (`f < 10³ Hz`):

ρ_grav = √(2πG) M / (4π r²)
F_grav = -G M m / r²

### 3.2 Electromagnetic Interaction

Arises from the photon density gradient, coupled through charge:

ρ_EM = α M / (4π r²)
F_EM = -α Q q / (4πε₀ r²)

### 3.3 Strong Interaction

Arises from the gluon field (including Yukawa attenuation):

ρ_strong = g_s² M / (4π r²) exp(-m_g r)
F_strong ∝ -g_s² M m / r³ exp(-m_g r)

### 3.4 Weak Interaction

Arises from the W/Z boson field:

ρ_weak = g_W² M / (4π r²) exp(-M_W r)
F_weak ∝ -(g_W² M m / r³ + g_W² M m M_W / r²) exp(-M_W r)

## 4. Dynamical Response Mechanism

### 4.1 State Change of Mass Quanta

Force acts on mass quanta, changing their state of motion via momentum transfer:

dp/dt = F = -κ m ∇ρ

This indicates that the rate of change of momentum of a mass quantum is directly determined by the density field gradient at its location.

### 4.2 Energy-Momentum Transfer Pathway

Energy quanta density gradient → Energy quanta flux → Velocity field → Momentum transfer → Mass quantum acceleration

This transfer pathway establishes a complete causal chain from the field gradient to the change in the motion state of mass quanta.

## 5. Theoretical Significance and Experimental Implications

### 5.1 Ontological Innovation

- Reduces the concept of force from geometric descriptions (General Relativity) or gauge theories (Standard Model) to a material process of energy quanta exchange.
- Establishes a causal mechanical framework based on the energy minimization principle.

### 5.2 Unification Achievement

- The four fundamental interactions are uniformly described as effects of the energy quanta density gradient across different frequency ranges.
- Connection between microscopic quantum processes and macroscopic classical mechanics is achieved at the level of energy quanta exchange.

### 5.3 Testable Predictions

- Predicts observable deviations between traditional potential field theories and the energy quanta density field model in extremely high-precision measurements.
- Suggests that in regions of strong gravitational fields, the energy quanta density distribution will significantly deviate from classical solutions.

## Conclusion

This theoretical framework provides, for the first time, a mechanistic definition of fundamental interactions based on the energy quanta density gradient. It achieves a theoretical leap from phenomenological description to essential explanation, opening a new path for unifying quantum theory and gravitational theory.
