## I. Core Definitions

### 1. Energy Quanta
- **Definition**: Fundamental quanta with no rest mass that propagate at the speed of light.
- **Core Description**: Their energy is directly defined by the Planck formula `E = hν`, where energy is proportional to frequency (`ν`).
- **Typical Representatives**: Photons, gluons, gravitons (hypothetical).

### 2. Mass Quanta
- **Definition**: Fundamental quanta with rest mass that typically move at subluminal speeds.
- **Core Description**: Their rest energy is defined by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence `E = mc²`, which can be equivalently expressed as a characteristic frequency `ν = mc²/h`.
- **Typical Representatives**: Electrons, quarks, W/Z bosons, the Higgs boson.

## II. Unified Framework and Core Roles

- **Unification**: Energy quanta and mass quanta are unified through the intrinsic parameter of frequency (`ν`) within the framework of the Planck formula `E = hν`. This framework reveals the unified nature of energy and mass at the quantum level.
- **Roles**:
  - **Energy Quanta**: Act as mediators of fundamental interactions (electromagnetic, strong, gravitational forces).
  - **Mass Quanta**: Constitute the building blocks of matter, forming the substance of the observable universe.

## III. Theoretical Significance

1. **Return to Physical Essence**: This classification uses the most fundamental physical concepts—"energy" and "mass"—as its basis, moving away from secondary characteristics like "statistical properties" derived from collective behavior. It is more intuitive and fundamental.
2. **Establishing the Centrality of Planck's Formula**: The Planck formula `E = hν` is established as the foundational principle for describing the energy of all quanta, emphasizing the primordial nature of quantization.
3. **Bridging the Micro and Macro Realms**: Through the frequency parameter, this framework naturally connects the microscopic world (high-frequency, short-range mass quanta) with the macroscopic cosmos (low-frequency, long-range energy quanta like gravitons).
4. **Providing a New Unifying Perspective**: The unification of energy and mass within the frequency dimension offers a novel path for unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity, distinct from the Standard Model approach.

## Comparison with the Standard Model Classification

| Aspect of Comparison | Standard Model (Bosons vs. Fermions) | Energy Quanta vs. Mass Quanta (EQT) |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Basis of Classification** | Spin and quantum statistical properties (behavior in multi-particle systems). | Rest mass and propagation speed (intrinsic physical attributes of individual particles). |
| **Core Philosophy** | Classifies particles based on their "behavior" and "symmetries." | Classifies particles based on their "essence" and "constitution." |
| **View of Planck's Formula** | An empirical starting point for quantum mechanics, later encompassed and explained by more fundamental field theories and symmetry principles. | The direct formula for energy quanta and the ultimate framework for unifying energy and mass. |
| **View of Statistical Properties** | Statistical properties are the core criterion for classification and a fundamental feature. | Statistical properties are derived phenomena from collective behavior of many particles, not an intrinsic feature. |
| **Role of the Higgs Boson** | A scalar boson that gives mass to other particles via the Higgs field. | A quintessential mass quantum; its high-frequency position may mark the dividing line between energy and mass quanta, explaining the origin of mass. |
| **Advantages** | Mathematically highly self-consistent, successfully predicts numerous phenomena, perfectly describes three fundamental forces. | More intuitive, directly linked to physical essence; more unified, integrates all particles via frequency; offers new avenues for quantum gravity. |
| **Challenges** | Cannot incorporate gravity; contains several free parameters. | Requires constructing a new mathematical framework to describe particle interactions; requires reinterpreting quantum statistical behavior. |

## Conclusion

The "Energy Quanta" vs. "Mass Quanta" classification in Energy Quanta Theory (EQT) represents a paradigm shift from "behavior-based classification" to "essence-based classification." It replaces a convenient theoretical framework (classification based on spin and statistics) with one that is more aligned with physical reality (classification based on energy and mass).

Its most profound implications are:

1. Demoting statistical properties to derived, collective behaviors emerging from intrinsic physical attributes (energy/mass/frequency).
2. Elevating Planck's formula and the frequency dimension to the status of the ultimate stage for unifying energy and mass, potentially providing a more fundamental starting point for physics.
