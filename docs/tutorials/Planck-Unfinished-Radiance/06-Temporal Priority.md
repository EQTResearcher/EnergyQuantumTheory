## 2.1 Temporal Priority

Planck's formula ($E = h\nu$, 1900) preceded Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula ($E = mc^2$, 1905) by five years, with its concept of energy quantization laying the crucial theoretical foundation for the proposal of mass-energy equivalence. By resolving the blackbody radiation problem and introducing discrete energy quanta, Planck overturned the continuity assumption of classical physics, revealing that energy in the microscopic world is quantized in units of $h\nu$. This breakthrough not only solved an experimental conundrum but also created an opportunity to reexamine the fundamental relationship between energy and matter.

In 1905, within the framework of special relativity, Einstein proposed $E = mc^2$, which unambiguously established the equivalence between mass and energy, indicating that mass is a condensed form of energy. Significantly, Einstein's light quantum hypothesis (1905) directly invoked Planck's $E = h\nu$, applying it to the photoelectric effect and demonstrating that light propagates in quantum form, thereby highlighting the pioneering role of Planck's formula. Planck's concept of quantization provided theoretical inspiration for Einstein: $E = h\nu$ describes microscopic energy through frequency, establishing the microscopic foundation for the macroscopic mass-energy equivalence expressed in $E = mc^2$.

The temporal gap and theoretical connection between the two formulas demonstrate that Planck's formula was not merely the starting point of quantum mechanics but also the origin of the concept of mass-energy unification. However, Planck's contribution has often been confined to its role as a solution to blackbody radiation, while $E = mc^2$ gained greater prominence due to the intuitive nature of its macroscopic applications, such as nuclear energy. This temporal priority and theoretical dependency underscore the pioneering status of Planck's formula in understanding microscopic mass-energy relationships, providing historical justification for the unified framework of the subsequent Energy Quantum Theory (EQT).
