## 3.3 Hypothesis of Gluon Rest Mass

The Standard Model defines gluons as massless bosons mediating the strong interaction, with their range confined to nuclear scales ($\sim 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$). However, based on the energy quanta/mass quanta classification rooted in Planck's formula ($E = h\nu$) and the mass-energy equivalence ($E = mc^2$), we propose that gluons may possess a small rest mass (hypothesized $m \sim 0.1 - 1 \, \text{MeV}/c^2$), thereby reclassifying them as mass quanta and challenging conventional understanding.

Assuming a gluon mass of $0.1 \, \text{MeV}/c^2$, the energy $E = 10^5 \, \text{eV}$ corresponds to an equivalent frequency $\nu = \frac{mc^2}{h} \approx 2.42 \times 10^{19} \, \text{Hz}$. For a mass of $1 \, \text{MeV}/c^2$ ($E = 10^6 \, \text{eV}$), $\nu \approx 2.42 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$, approaching the frequency range of electrons ($\nu \approx 1.24 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$). This frequency range lies in the transitional zone between energy quanta ($< 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$, e.g., photons) and mass quanta ($> 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$, e.g., Higgs $\sim 3.02 \times 10^{25} \, \text{Hz}$), suggesting that gluons may exhibit characteristics of both energy quanta and mass quanta.

The gluon mass hypothesis stems from confinement effects in strong interactions: in quark-gluon plasmas, gluons demonstrate mass-like behavior with limited interaction ranges, resembling the decay properties of massive particles. Planck's formula provides a unified description of gluon energy through $E = h\nu$, while $E = mc^2$ incorporates them into the mass quanta framework, reinforcing the unity of energy and mass.

This hypothesis challenges the Standard Model's assumption of massless gluons and suggests that strong interactions might involve unknown mass-generation mechanisms. If gluons possess rest mass, their positioning in the transitional frequency range ($10^{20} - 10^{26} \, \text{Hz}$) could complement the mass-conferring role of the Higgs boson, potentially revealing microscopic mechanisms for the transformation between energy quanta and mass quanta.

This hypothesis provides crucial support for Energy Quantum Theory (EQT), redefines particle classification, and advances theoretical exploration toward the unification of microscopic mass-energy relationships.
