## 5.2 The Authentic Essence of Planck's Formula

Planck's formula ($E = h\nu$), originating from the direct insight gained through blackbody radiation experiments in 1900, embodies a phenomenon-driven essence and a simple mathematical form. It directly describes the energy quantization characteristic of energy quanta (e.g., photons at $10^6 - 10^{19} \, \text{Hz}$, gravitons at $\sim 10^2 - 10^3 \, \text{Hz}$), revealing the fundamental truth of physics.

Unlike the wave function, which relies on the complex framework of Hilbert spaces and probability calculus, $E = h\nu$ starts from experimental data. It uses Planck's constant ($h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$) and frequency ($\nu$) to intuitively express the discrete nature of energy, thereby uncovering a core principle of the microscopic world. The photon, a quintessential energy quantum, has its energy directly determined by its frequency, embodying light-speed propagation and long-range influence (e.g., electromagnetic wave propagation across cosmic scales). The graviton, inferred from gravitational wave observations ($\sim 10^2 - 10^3 \, \text{Hz}$), is similarly described by $E = h\nu$, capturing its low-frequency, long-range characteristics.

Furthermore, by integrating with the mass-energy equivalence formula ($E = mc^2$), Planck's formula incorporates mass quanta (e.g., electrons, $\nu \approx 1.24 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$; Higgs boson, $\nu \approx 3.02 \times 10^{25} \, \text{Hz}$) into a unified framework. It describes the energy equivalence of rest mass through the equivalent frequency ($\nu = \frac{mc^2}{h}$). This simplicity makes it applicable not only to the microscopic behavior of energy quanta but also, via frequency, extends to mass quanta. It thereby surpasses the wave function, which shows a bias towards describing mass quanta (like electrons and quarks) and is inadequate for describing energy quanta.

Rooted in the experimental reality of blackbody radiation, Planck's formula avoids the mathematical complexity of quantum field theory and exemplifies a phenomenon-driven scientific spirit. Its power to unify energy quanta and mass quanta provides the theoretical cornerstone for the Energy Quantum Theory (EQT). It challenges the overly mathematical bias prevalent in quantum mechanics and helps restore the phenomenon-oriented essence of physics.
