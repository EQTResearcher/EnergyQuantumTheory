# Chapter 1: Planck's Revolution – The Quantum Light of Blackbody Radiation

## 1.2 The Birth of $E = h\nu$

From October to December 1900, in the final sprint of his research on blackbody radiation, Max Planck proposed the epoch-making hypothesis of energy quantization: $E = h\nu$. This formula originated not from an inspiration of mathematical derivation, but from his persistent analysis of experimental spectral data. Confronted with the failures of both Wien's law and the Rayleigh-Jeans law, and relying on the high-precision spectral measurements by Rubens and Kurlbaum, Planck sought to construct a mathematical model that accurately described the full spectral distribution of blackbody radiation from low to high frequencies. He boldly hypothesized that the energy of oscillators within the blackbody cavity was not continuous, but existed in discrete "energy elements," each given by $E = h\nu$, where $h$ (approximately $6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$) is Planck's constant and $\nu$ is the frequency of the oscillator. This assumption violated the classical principle of continuity, yet it perfectly fit the experimental data.

On December 14, 1900, in a report to the German Physical Society, Planck first publicly presented $E = h\nu$ and introduced the concept of energy quantization, stunning the scientific community. He initially regarded it as a "provisional hypothesis," unaware that this formula would completely overturn classical physics and herald the dawn of the quantum mechanics era. $E = h\nu$ not only solved the problem of blackbody radiation but also contained a profound insight into the micro-scale mass-energy relationship: energy exists in quantized form, foreshadowing the unification of mass and energy (to be later elaborated through $E = mc^2$). Planck's scientific method exemplified a fidelity to phenomena; starting from experimental data and discarding classical assumptions, he demonstrated a phenomenon-driven scientific spirit. However, physicists of the time, including Planck himself, failed to immediately recognize the revolutionary significance of $E = h\nu$. It was initially viewed merely as a mathematical fitting tool, and its far-reaching implications for the microscopic world remained unforeseen.
