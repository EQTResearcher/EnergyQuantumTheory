# Preamble

This preamble aims to reveal the revolutionary significance of Planck's formula $E = h\nu$, proposing the "Energy Quantum Theory (EQT)" as a new framework for unifying micro- and macro-physics. It critiques the current over-reliance on the mathematical logic of wave functions in quantum mechanics, which often overlooks the phenomenon-driven essence of physics. Originating from the solution to the blackbody radiation problem in 1900, Planck's formula first introduced energy quantization, laying the cornerstone of quantum mechanics. However, it has been confined to explaining isolated phenomena, failing to fully recognize the micro-scale mass-energy relationship it reveals. EQT takes Planck's formula as its core, integrating Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula $E = mc^2$. It unifies energy quanta (massless, propagating at light speed, e.g., photons, gravitons) and mass quanta (possessing rest mass, e.g., electrons, Higgs bosons, gluons) through frequency, transcending the Standard Model's boson/fermion classification and reshaping the foundation of physics. Due to the anthropic principle, human observation is biased towards mass quanta, obscuring the fundamental truth revealed by Planck's formula. EQT calls for a return to phenomenon-driven inquiry, exploring the unification of energy and mass.
