# Chapter 2: Planck and Einstein â€” The Convergence of Micro and Macro

## 2.3 Reasons for Neglect

Planck's formula ($E = h\nu$), while revealing the fundamental nature of microscopic energy quantization, failed to gain recognition comparable to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence ($E = mc^2$) due to its abstract nature and lack of direct macroscopic applications. $E = mc^2$, through its demonstration of mass-energy equivalence, directly relates to macroscopic phenomena such as nuclear reactions, atomic weapons, and stellar energy release. Its intuitive appeal and dramatic technological implications rapidly established it as an iconic symbol of 20th-century physics.

In contrast, Planck's formula remained confined to the microscopic domain, initially perceived merely as a mathematical solution to blackbody radiation, with its universal significance remaining largely unrecognized. The scientific community's entrenched reliance on classical physics and general unfamiliarity with quantization concepts further obscured the deeper implications of $E = h\nu$.

While Planck's formula describes the microscopic behavior of energy quanta (such as photons) through frequency and contains profound insights about mass-energy unity, its complexity in experimental verification (as seen in the photoelectric effect requiring Einstein's subsequent explanation) and theoretical abstraction prevented immediate widespread discussion. Additionally, Planck's cautious personal attitude and the conservative scientific atmosphere of his time allowed the fundamental truth of $E = h\nu$ to be overshadowed by the brilliant macroscopic implications of $E = mc^2$.

Society's focus on technological progress further amplified the impact of $E = mc^2$, while Planck's formula, as a pioneering concept in microscopic mass-energy relationships, saw its profound potential long overlooked.
