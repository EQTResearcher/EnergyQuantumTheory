# Chapter 4: The Revelation of Frequency – Interaction Range and Physical Essence

## 4.2 Frequency-Interaction Range Relationship

Planck's formula ($E = h\nu$), combined with the mass-energy equivalence ($E = mc^2$), reveals through frequency sequencing a profound connection between particle interaction range and energy/mass properties, providing physical justification for Energy Quantum Theory (EQT).

Energy Quanta, such as photons (frequency $10^6 - 10^{19} \, \text{Hz}$) and gravitons ($\sim 10^2 - 10^3 \, \text{Hz}$, based on gravitational wave observations), are massless and propagate at light speed, exhibiting vast interaction ranges:

- Photons can traverse cosmic scales ($\sim 10^{26} \, \text{m}$)
- Gravitons influence galactic distances ($\sim 10^{23} \, \text{m}$) through gravitational waves

Their low-frequency characteristics ($< 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$) correspond to relatively lower energy levels, enabling propagation unconstrained by mass.

Mass Quanta, including electrons ($m \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2$, $\nu \approx 1.24 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$), top quarks ($m \approx 173 \, \text{GeV}/c^2$, $\nu \approx 4.18 \times 10^{25} \, \text{Hz}$), and Higgs bosons ($m \approx 125 \, \text{GeV}/c^2$, $\nu \approx 3.02 \times 10^{25} \, \text{Hz}$), possess rest mass with frequencies above $10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$ (calculated via $\nu = \frac{mc^2}{h}$, $h \approx 4.1357 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV·s}$). High-frequency mass quanta exhibit extremely short interaction ranges due to their substantial energy and rapid decay:

- Higgs and W/Z bosons ($\nu \approx 1.94 - 3.02 \times 10^{25} \, \text{Hz}$) are confined to $\sim 10^{-18} \, \text{m}$
- Electrons, mediated by electromagnetic interaction, extend slightly further ($\sim 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$)

Gluons, hypothesized to possess rest mass ($\sim 0.1 - 1 \, \text{MeV}/c^2$, $\nu \approx 2.42 \times 10^{19} - 2.42 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$), exhibit strong interaction ranges confined to nuclear scales ($\sim 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$), consistent with the short-range characteristics of high-frequency mass quanta.

The inverse correlation between frequency and interaction range (low frequency → extensive range, high frequency → limited range) reflects the fundamental distinction between massless energy quanta propagating at light speed and mass quanta constrained by rest mass.

Through frequency, Planck's formula provides a unified description of both particle categories, revealing the physical principles governing energy and mass as manifested in interaction ranges. This understanding offers crucial evidence for EQT's unification of microscopic quantum behavior and macroscopic gravitational effects.
