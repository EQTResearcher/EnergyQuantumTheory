## 5.4 Reasons for the Neglect of Planck's Contribution

Planck's formula ($E = h\nu$), as the foundation of quantum mechanics, reveals the essence of microscopic energy quantization. Yet, due to its abstract microscopic nature and lack of direct, dramatic macroscopic applications, it never achieved the same level of scientific and societal recognition as Einstein's mass-energy equivalence ($E = mc^2$). $E = mc^2$, through its demonstration of mass-energy equivalence, directly relates to macroscopic phenomena like nuclear fission, fusion, and stellar energy release. Its practical applications in the 20th century, such as the devastating power of the atomic bomb in 1945 releasing $\sim 10^{14} \, \text{J}$ of energy, provided tangible verification, cementing its status as an icon of general relativity deeply embedded in both public and scientific consciousness.

In contrast, $E = h\nu$ originated from the 1900 blackbody radiation experiments, describing the discrete energy nature of energy quanta like photons (frequency $10^6 - 10^{19} \, \text{Hz}$). Its microscopic character relied on high-precision spectral measurements (e.g., experiments by Rubens and Kurlbaum), with an indirect verification process confined to laboratories, lacking direct engineering or societal impact. The core of Planck's formula—Planck's constant ($h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$)—defines energy discreteness at the microscopic scale, but its extremely small magnitude prevents perceptible effects in the macroscopic world, leading to its perception as a merely "technical" formula confined to explaining blackbody radiation or the photoelectric effect.

The cognitive inertia within the scientific community further exacerbated the underestimation of $E = h\nu$. From the late 19th to early 20th century, the continuous paradigm of classical physics (e.g., Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell's electromagnetic theory) still dominated. Planck's quantization hypothesis was viewed as a mathematical trick rather than a breakthrough in physical reality. Planck himself, after 1900, repeatedly referred to $E = h\nu$ as an "act of desperation," not considering it a universal principle. Contemporaries like Boltzmann and Wien, while acknowledging its effectiveness in fitting experimental data, questioned its physical significance, preferring classical statistical mechanics to explain blackbody radiation. This conservative attitude prevented an in-depth exploration of $E = h\nu$'s potential for unifying microscopic mass-energy relationships—a potential realized by converting mass quanta frequencies via $E = mc^2$ (e.g., electron $\nu \approx 1.24 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$, Higgs $\nu \approx 3.02 \times 10^{25} \, \text{Hz}$, hypothesized gluon $\nu \approx 2.42 \times 10^{19} - 2.42 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$).

The subsequent development of quantum mechanics further diverged from the phenomenon-driven essence of Planck's formula. The wave function ($\psi$) and Schrödinger equation (1926) emphasized mathematical probability descriptions, focusing on the localized behavior of mass quanta (e.g., electrons, quarks) while neglecting the light-speed propagation and long-range characteristics of energy quanta (e.g., photons, gravitons). This shift obscured the unifying power of $E = h\nu$.

Philosophical and social contexts also played crucial roles in the neglect of Planck's formula. Philosophically, the early 20th century positivism emphasized direct verification through observable phenomena. $E = mc^2$ gained validation through the immense energy release of nuclear power, while the microscopic effects of $E = h\nu$ required precise instruments (e.g., spectrometers or photoelectric effect experiments) for verification, making it less philosophically resonant. Socially, the post-Industrial Revolution era's push for technological progress favored practical science. The nuclear applications of $E = mc^2$ aligned with this trend, whereas the microscopic insights from $E = h\nu$, though foundational for semiconductors and lasers, received less attention due to their indirect and long-term nature. Furthermore, the Anthropic Principle made localized phenomena of mass quanta (e.g., atomic spectra) more accessible to human observation, while the cosmic-scale effects of energy quanta (e.g., gravitons, $\sim 10^2 - 10^3 \, \text{Hz}$) were harder to capture directly, further diminishing the perceived significance of Planck's formula.

The phenomenon-driven authenticity of Planck's formula—its concise unity derived from blackbody radiation experiments—was ultimately overshadowed by the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics and the macroscopic prominence of $E = mc^2$. This historical and philosophical context provides justification for Energy Quantum Theory (EQT) to reclaim the formula's potential for unifying microscopic mass-energy relationships.
