## 4.4 The Unifying Power of Planck's Formula

Planck's formula ($E = h\nu$), with frequency ($\nu$) as its core parameter and combined with Einstein's mass-energy equivalence ($E = mc^2$), provides a theoretical framework that unifies energy quanta and mass quanta. This framework transcends the macroscopic limitations of $E = mc^2$ and establishes the foundation for Energy Quantum Theory (EQT).

Energy quanta (e.g., photons with frequency $10^6 - 10^{19} \, \text{Hz}$; gravitons at $\sim 10^2 - 10^3 \, \text{Hz}$) lack rest mass, and their energy is directly defined by $E = h\nu$, where frequency reflects their propagation characteristics. Mass quanta (e.g., electrons with $m \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2$, $\nu \approx 1.24 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$; Higgs boson with $m \approx 125 \, \text{GeV}/c^2$, $\nu \approx 3.02 \times 10^{25} \, \text{Hz}$) are incorporated into Planck's frequency framework through equivalent frequency conversion ($\nu = \frac{mc^2}{h}$, $h \approx 4.1357 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{eV·s}$). Even gluons, hypothesized to possess rest mass ($\sim 0.1 - 1 \, \text{MeV}/c^2$, $\nu \approx 2.42 \times 10^{19} - 2.42 \times 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$), can be described by $E = h\nu$, unifying them within the transition zone ($10^{20} - 10^{26} \, \text{Hz}$).

The unifying power of Planck's formula lies in how frequency not only describes the microscopic quantized behavior of energy quanta but also, through $E = mc^2$, converts the rest energy of mass quanta into frequency, revealing the fundamental equivalence between energy and mass. In contrast, while $E = mc^2$ elucidates macroscopic mass-energy equivalence, it lacks the dynamic description of microscopic quantization and depends on the pioneering concepts introduced by Planck's formula.

The Higgs mechanism within the transition zone further strengthens this unification. By conferring mass, it connects energy quanta to mass quanta, demonstrating the continuity of frequency from low values (cosmic-scale interaction ranges) to high values (subnuclear scales). The simplicity and phenomenon-driven nature of Planck's formula – originating from blackbody radiation experiments – enable it to transcend the mathematical complexity of the Standard Model. It provides EQT with a theoretical basis for unifying microscopic quantum mechanics and macroscopic general relativity, revealing deeper laws governing the physical world.
