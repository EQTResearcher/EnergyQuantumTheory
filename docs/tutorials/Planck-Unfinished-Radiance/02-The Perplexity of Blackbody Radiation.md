# Chapter 1: Planck's Revolution – The Quantum Light of Blackbody Radiation

## 1.1 The Perplexity of Blackbody Radiation

By the end of the 19th century, physics seemed to have reached its peak. Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, and thermodynamics constituted the magnificent edifice of classical physics. However, a seemingly simple problem – blackbody radiation – exposed a fatal flaw in classical theory, triggering a profound crisis in physics. This issue not only challenged the prevailing scientific paradigm but also laid the groundwork for Planck's revolutionary quantum hypothesis.

A blackbody, an idealized physical model, is defined as an object that perfectly absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation and emits energy in the form of thermal radiation. The spectral distribution of a blackbody (i.e., the radiated energy at different frequencies) should be determined solely by its temperature, independent of its material composition. This concept, proposed by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1860, became the theoretical cornerstone for studying thermal radiation. Experimental physicists, using precision instruments to measure blackbody spectra, sought to verify the predictions of classical theory. Yet, the experimental results revealed an irreconcilable contradiction with theoretical expectations, historically known as the "ultraviolet catastrophe."

The classical theory of thermal radiation was based on Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and the equipartition of energy. Around 1900, Lord Rayleigh and James Jeans developed the Rayleigh-Jeans formula, modeling the electromagnetic waves within a blackbody cavity as standing waves with energy equally distributed across all frequencies. According to this model, the energy density of blackbody radiation should increase infinitely at high frequencies (short wavelengths, such as ultraviolet), leading to the absurd prediction that a blackbody would emit infinite energy. This "ultraviolet catastrophe" completely contradicted experimental observations, which showed energy rapidly decreasing in the high-frequency region.

Meanwhile, Wilhelm Wien, in 1896, proposed Wien's displacement law, which described the spectral distribution reasonably well at high frequencies but failed in the low-frequency (long wavelength, such as infrared) region. Experimental data indicated that radiated energy increased with frequency in the low-frequency region, contrary to the predictions of Wien's law. The dual failure of both Wien's law and the Rayleigh-Jeans formula exposed the inability of classical physics at the microscopic scale, forcing physicists to re-examine the very nature of energy distribution.

Max Planck, a rigorous German physicist, found himself at the heart of this scientific crisis. Born in Kiel in 1858, he entered the University of Munich in 1874 and later studied at the University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz and Gustav Kirchhoff, deeply immersing himself in thermodynamics and electromagnetic theory. Planck held a firm belief in classical physics and initially sought to reconcile the theoretical and experimental contradictions of blackbody radiation by refining thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. In his Berlin laboratory, he closely followed the latest spectral measurements from experimental physicists like Heinrich Rubens and Ferdinand Kurlbaum. This high-precision data revealed the complete picture of the blackbody spectrum: radiated energy increased linearly with frequency in the low-frequency region, peaked in the mid-frequency region, and dropped sharply in the high-frequency region. This spectral shape became the starting point for Planck's investigation.

Planck's scientific methodology embodied a phenomenon-driven philosophy. He did not start from mathematical axioms but delved into the details of experimental data, striving to extract patterns from the phenomena themselves. He noted that the classical assumption of continuous energy distribution led to the absurdity of infinite energy at high frequencies. Planck began to suspect whether energy distribution might possess some discontinuous character. This question challenged a core assumption of classical physics but also planted the seed for the birth of quantum mechanics. Between 1897 and 1900, Planck repeatedly analyzed experimental spectra, attempting to construct a mathematical model that could fit the data across both low and high-frequency regions. His working environment – the Physics Institute at the University of Berlin – brought together the era's cutting-edge experimental equipment and data, providing a solid foundation for his theoretical breakthrough.

Planck's journey was not smooth. His diaries and correspondence record his inner struggle: on one hand, he deeply believed in the continuity assumption of classical physics; on the other, the experimental data compelled him to consider radical possibilities. In October 1900, at a meeting of the German Physical Society, Planck presented a preliminary interpolation formula aimed at bridging the gap between Wien's law and the Rayleigh-Jeans formula. Although this formula could fit the experimental data, it lacked a physical basis, leading Planck to call it an "act of desperation." Yet, this attempt marked his step towards the idea of quantization, foreshadowing the birth of $E = h\nu$.

The perplexity of the blackbody radiation problem was not merely Planck's personal scientific challenge; it was a turning point for physics at the end of the 19th century. It revealed the limitations of classical physics at the microscopic scale, forcing scientists to confront the fundamental nature of energy distribution. Planck's perseverance and his dialogue with experimental data epitomize the spirit of phenomenon-driven science: starting from observation, challenging existing paradigms, and seeking new laws. This process laid the cornerstone for the creation of quantum mechanics and paved the way for the revolutionary contribution of Planck's formula $E = h\nu$ in revealing the micro-scale mass-energy relationship.
