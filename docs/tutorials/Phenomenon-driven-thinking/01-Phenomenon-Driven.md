## Aggregation as the Mode of Cosmic Evolution

Quarks → Hadrons → Atoms → Molecules → Celestial Bodies—the mode of cosmic evolution is **aggregation**.

The tendency toward aggregation is a prerequisite for the evolution of complexity. Random motion, including the thermal motion of **massons** (particles with rest mass, e.g., quarks, electrons) at subluminal speeds and the luminal propagation of **energons** (massless particles, e.g., photons, gravitons), is an inherent (fundamental) property of the universe. The random motion of all particles is key, making random collisions possible, and this possibility creates the conditions for aggregation.

However, **time** and **space** turn all possibilities into certainties:
- **Time** enables random collisions to become fully traversed, meaning that all particles may have interacted with each other, and all combinations of particles may have occurred. Long-term, fully traversed interactions:
  1. Promote the commonality of motion among all mass particles (massons) (spin + helical + linear motion).
  2. Facilitate the mutual transfer and exchange of energy.
- **Space** serves as a means to increase probability—increased density can significantly enhance the likelihood of collisions.

## Energy Release and Minimization

Energy release is a widespread phenomenon in nature:
- **Macroscopic Scales**: Gravitationally driven nebular collapse releases potential energy, forming stars and triggering nuclear fusion, as seen in the energy transformation during the formation of the solar system from molecular clouds.
- **Microscopic Scales**: Electromagnetically facilitated chemical bond formation (e.g., hydrogen molecule combination) releases chemical energy, driving molecular self-organization.

These energy release processes indicate that systems tend to reconfigure energy to achieve lower states. This dynamic process of **energy minimization** constitutes the core mechanism of forces.

## Emergence of Complexity

The emergence of complexity is one of the central features of cosmic evolution. While the universe as a whole tends toward a high-entropy homogeneous state, localized regions (e.g., galaxies and living systems) form **low-entropy, high-complexity structures** through energy dissipation. This phenomenon aligns with **dissipative structure theory**, as seen in:
- Self-organization in chemical reactions.
- Formation of life-supporting conditions in planetary systems.

**Gravity** drives complexity on macroscopic scales in large-scale structures, while **electromagnetic forces** foster chemical and biological complexity on microscopic scales. The synergy between the two suggests a potential underlying consistency in microscopic mechanisms.

## Summary: From Randomness to Certainty

Random collisions may trigger local motion or energy changes, generating perturbations that lead to aggregation. This increases local abundance or density, further amplifying the potential for aggregation and gradually forming a **positive feedback loop**. The universe appears random but is, in fact, **deterministic**:

**Randomness + Time and Space → Certainty!**

**Random (perturbations) → Action of Time + Action of Space → Aggregation → Release (positive feedback) → Growth of Complexity.**

## The Role of Fundamental Forces

The physical laws enabling aggregation are the **four fundamental forces**, which are merely external manifestations rather than internal mechanisms:
- **Electromagnetic Force**: Relatively well-understood, primarily governing interactions between atoms and molecules.
- **Weak and Strong Forces**: Govern interactions among hadrons and atomic nuclei.
- **Gravity**: Acts macroscopically on all masses—including particles or matter with rest mass and those with energy but no rest mass—forming molecular clouds, stars, planets, galaxies, galaxy clusters, and cosmic webs.
