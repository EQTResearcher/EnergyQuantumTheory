## Introduction to Force in Energy Quantum Theory (EQT)

The core of the **Energy Quantum Theory (EQT)** lies in constructing a framework for unifying the fundamental interactions by starting from observable physical phenomena. It proposes that the **dynamic process of energy minimization** between mass bodies serves as the unified mechanism for force, specifically manifested as the process where the dynamic changes in the **energy quantum number density gradient** tend towards uniformity.

## Energy Minimization as a Universal Mechanism of Force

In nature, the evolution of systems universally follows the principle of **energy minimization**. This dynamic process is not only a common feature of interactions such as **gravity** and **electromagnetic force** but also a key driver behind the formation of ordered structures from chaos in the universe.

- **Macroscopic Scales**: Gravity causes matter to aggregate towards regions of lowest potential energy. For instance, nebulae collapse under gravity to form stars, releasing immense gravitational potential energy converted into thermal and radiative energy. This process is evident in the formation of galaxies and planetary systems.
- **Microscopic Scales**: Electromagnetic force drives the combination of atoms and molecules through the minimization of electrical potential energy, such as the release of chemical energy during electron cloud rearrangement when oxygen molecules form.

Whether for gravity or electromagnetic force, energy minimization manifests as the system reconfiguring its energy state to achieve a more stable configuration. This universality suggests that **force** is not an isolated entity but a dynamic manifestation of **energy redistribution**. EQT proposes that the mechanism underlying all forces originates from the dynamic process of energy minimization, achieved through the **exchange and propagation of energy quanta**, laying the foundation for a unified theory.

## Energy Quantum Density Gradient and the Origin of Force

The macroscopic effects of gravity (e.g., planetary orbits, galaxy cluster formation) are often attributed to spacetime curvature caused by mass or the exchange of gravitons. However, EQT proposes a new explanation: **gravity originates from the density gradient of energy quanta** (including both high-energy and low-energy) surrounding celestial bodies.

- **Energy Quantum Density Field**: Each celestial body is surrounded by an energy quantum density field, where the density decreases with distance, approximately following a $\rho(r) \propto 1/r^2$ distribution. When two celestial bodies approach each other, the energy quantum density on their facing sides reaches a maximum due to superposition effects. This high-density region, through the exchange and diffusion of energy quanta, generates an **attractive force** that tends towards energy minimization.
- **Unified Mechanism**: This mechanism not only explains the macroscopic manifestations of gravity but also shares a similar physical picture with the microscopic behavior of electromagnetic force (e.g., attraction between charges). For instance, electromagnetic force drives the reduction of potential energy between charges through photon exchange; similarly, gravity might drive the aggregation of mass through the density gradient of low-energy energy quanta (e.g., gravitons).
- **Dynamic Balance**: EQT hypothesizes that the dynamic evolution of the energy quantum density field (tending towards uniformity) and the aggregation of matter driven by gravity (increasing local density) form a dynamic balance, revealing the essence of gravity as a macroscopic phenomenon.

The energy quantum hypothesis proposes that gravity originates from the gradient $\nabla \rho$ of the energy quantum density field $\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$ surrounding celestial bodies. Through the exchange of gravitons, it drives matter towards regions of higher density, forming an attractive force. The force is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{F} \propto -\nabla \rho
$$

This section details the derivation of how the density gradient $\nabla \rho$ generates a force $\mathbf{F} \propto -\nabla \rho$, verifies its consistency with classical Newtonian gravity $F \propto G M_1 M_2 / r^2$, analyzes the contributions of positive feedback and quantum corrections, and validates the theory using astronomical observations (e.g., gravitational waves, galaxy formation) and numerical simulations, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the unified framework of the energy quantum hypothesis.

## Formation Mechanism of the Energy Quantum Density Gradient

The **Standard Model** categorizes fundamental particles into fermions and bosons. EQT, however, classifies particles based on **frequency** into **energy quanta** and **mass quanta**:

- **Energy Quanta**: Possess energy but no rest mass, e.g., photons and gluons. Their energy is $\Delta E = h f$, where $f$ is the frequency, and they propagate at the speed of light, exhibiting wave-particle duality. They possess characteristics such as spin, wave motion (vibration or curvilinear, with wave frequency $f$), and linear propagation.
- **Mass Quanta**: Possess both mass and energy, e.g., quarks, protons, and neutrons.

### Characteristics of Energy Quanta

- **Frequency-Based Classification**: Energy quanta can be classified by frequency:
  - **High wave frequencies** ($f \sim 10^{15} - 10^{20} \, \text{Hz}$): Manifest electromagnetic effects.
  - **Low wave frequencies** ($f \sim 10^{-1} - 10^3 \, \text{Hz}$): Manifest gravitational effects.
  - **Extremely high wave frequencies** ($f \sim 10^{23} - 10^{24} \, \text{Hz}$): Manifest gluon effects, reflecting the magnitude of energy and the range of interaction.
- **Role**: Energy quanta transfer energy, forming energy quantum density gradients or energy fields, generating forces of **aggregation (attraction)** or **separation (repulsion)**.
- **Detection Limits**: The universe is filled with various types of energy quanta, but currently, humanity can only detect electromagnetic energy quanta (photons). Energy quanta with extremely low or high oscillation frequencies remain undetectable.

### Energy Release and Aggregation

- **Decay and Aggregation**: The decay or aggregation of mass quanta generally releases energy quanta. Decay releases high-energy quanta, while aggregation releases low-energy quanta. Aggregated structures exist premised on minimum energy.
- **Energy Quanta Distribution**: The surroundings of an aggregated object are filled with released energy quanta, necessarily possessing an **energy quantum gradient**. An **energy field** is the manifestation of the distribution of energy quanta.
- **Force Generation**: The energy quanta released by decay or aggregation are quantized. The tighter the binding, the more energy is released, and the more stable the aggregate structure. Breaking this stability requires greater impact energy. For example, when celestial bodies aggregate, they release energy quanta; after collapse, they continue to release energy quanta, while decay also constantly occurs, leading to the continuous release of high-energy quanta.
- **Gravity Hypothesis**: The facing sides of two celestial bodies have the highest concentration of energy quanta and tend towards uniformity (the dynamic process of energy minimization). This is proposed as the cause of gravity, where mutual approach (the tendency to aggregate) is a dynamic process where energy tends towards minimization, forming the mechanism behind the generation of force.

## Microscopic and Macroscopic Levels

### Microscopic Level

Energy quanta and mass quanta jointly drive the evolution of the universe:
- **Mass Quanta**: Act as both producers and recipients of energy quanta, generating a potential tendency for aggregation through random motion. The energy carried by a mass quantum consists of four parts:
  - **Spin Energy**: Typically a small portion, more of a characteristic property.
  - **Translational Energy**: Kinetic energy, related to the square of the translational velocity.
  - **Wave Energy**: Quantized energy related to Planck’s formula ($E = h f$).
  - **Rest Mass Energy**: Energy corresponding to the rest mass.
- **Interactions**: Mass quanta release energy quanta through decay or aggregation, changing their mass or kinetic energy. Conversely, energy quanta act upon mass quanta, altering their mass or energy. This is the microscopic essence of interactions, such as the electromagnetic force between charged particles arising from the exchange of photons.

### Macroscopic Level

- **Mass-Energy Equivalence**: Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence equation ($E = mc^2$) and Planck’s formula ($E = h f$) both involve energy. Microscopic phenomena observed from a human perspective are statistical outcomes resulting from the collective interactions of vast numbers of microscopic particles.
- **Emergent Properties**: Macroscopic statistical laws often exhibit emergent properties, derived from numerous microscopic motions. For example:
  - **Thermal Energy**: Heat and temperature are macroscopic manifestations of the kinetic energy of numerous particles.
  - **Gravity**: The effect of an immense number of energy quanta (gravitons) acting together, presenting a statistical outcome, much like how the motion of numerous molecules manifests as thermal phenomena. However, gravitons themselves satisfy the requirement of quantization.
- **Force as a Macroscopic Phenomenon**: Force is a macroscopic phenomenon, a dynamic process where the density field formed by vast numbers of energy quanta tends towards uniformity.
