# Summary and Outlook

## Current Progress in Energy Quantum Theory (EQT)

Preliminary analyses have been conducted on **gravity**, **dark matter**, **dark energy**, and the nature of **charge** and **mass**, adopting a **phenomenon-driven approach** to explain force and physics. While **pure mathematics** excels at curve-fitting and can yield desired results, it often lacks physical explanation, treating many properties as intrinsic. This situation echoes historical debates, such as the **geocentric vs. heliocentric models**. Ultimately, **physics is physics, not mathematics**. Gravity, as a **macroscopic phenomenon**, cannot be directly unified with the microscopic mechanisms of quantum mechanics. True unification requires a clear understanding of the **internal mechanism of force**.

## Frequency-Based Classification and Planck’s Formula

The **frequency-based classification** of particles in EQT originates from **Planck’s formula** ($E = h f$), the cornerstone of quantum mechanics. Human observation is constrained by our scale, which lies in the **medium-to-high frequency range** where the **electromagnetic force** dominates. This makes it challenging to comprehend physics at **extremely high** and **extremely low frequencies** due to observational limitations:

- **Extremely High Frequencies** (>10²⁰ Hz): These can be approached using statistical methods, yielding statistical results (e.g., strong and weak force interactions).
- **Extremely Low Frequencies** (10⁻⁴–10⁻³³ Hz): Statistical methods are less effective, posing a significant challenge for humanity.

**Energy** serves as the entry point for understanding these phenomena. Detailed studies of **photons** reveal they are pure energy, described by Planck’s formula ($E = h f$), and propagate at the speed of light, distinct from particles with mass. Human temporal and spatial scales limit our ability to observe high-frequency spacetime scales directly. However, **segmentation of relatively high frequencies** offers a promising new direction in physics, potentially enabling deeper insights into these regimes.

## Energy Quantum Theory’s Definition of Time and Space

EQT redefines fundamental concepts:
- **Time**: Defined as the **change in energy quantum density** ($\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}$).
- **Space**: Defined as the **distribution of energy quantum density** ($\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$).

This framework aligns closely with the **spacetime view** of the **Big Bang theory**, providing a coherent physical basis for understanding cosmic evolution and the unification of forces through the energy quantum density field.

## Outlook

The Energy Quantum Theory aims to unify fundamental interactions by focusing on the **dynamic process of energy minimization** and the **energy quantum density gradient** ($\nabla \rho$). Future efforts will focus on:
- Developing **numerical simulations** to model the evolution of the energy quantum density field and validate predictions against observational data (e.g., gravitational waves, CMB fluctuations).
- Proposing **tabletop experiments** to detect low-frequency energy quanta (e.g., gravitons) and test EQT’s predictions in the low-frequency regime.
- Expanding the **frequency-based classification** to explore speculative ultra-high frequency particles and their role in new physics.
- Leveraging **AI-augmented research** to enhance theoretical derivations, simulations, and data analysis, while ensuring rigorous human validation.

By grounding physics in observable phenomena and the energy-based framework, EQT seeks to move beyond mathematical abstractions, offering a path toward a unified understanding of forces and cosmic evolution.
