## Section 3.2: Macroscopic Necessity: Positive Feedback and Structure Formation

The Theory of Energy Quanta transforms microscopic randomness into macroscopic necessity through positive feedback mechanisms, revealing the formation process of cosmic structures from disorder to order. This section focuses on how the positive feedback mechanism amplifies Energy Quanta density perturbations via the $k \rho^2$ term in the dynamic equation, driving the formation of macroscopic structures—from random collisions to galaxies and planets. It analyzes the physical mechanisms involved and uses the formation of galaxy clusters in the IllustrisTNG numerical simulation as an example to illustrate how macroscopic necessity emerges from microscopic randomness, along with the profound philosophical implications of this process.

### Positive Feedback Mechanism and Amplification of Density Perturbations
In the Theory of Energy Quanta, the formation of macroscopic structures originates from the amplification of microscopic random perturbations, with the core mechanism being the positive feedback term in the dynamic equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = k \rho^m - D \nabla^2 \rho - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) + S,
$$

where the positive feedback term $k \rho^m$ (typically with $m=2$) causes the Energy Quanta density $\rho$ in high-density regions to increase further, driving the aggregation of Mass Quanta and forming gravitational potential wells. The physical essence of positive feedback lies in this: initial minute perturbations (e.g., quantum fluctuations), under the influence of the density gradient $\nabla \rho$, attract more Mass Quanta through Energy Quanta exchange (e.g., gravitons), leading to a further increase in density. This nonlinear process transforms randomness at the microscopic scale into ordered structures at the macroscopic scale.

For example, density perturbations in the early universe (amplitude ~$10^{-5}$) were amplified by positive feedback, forming gravitational potential wells that attracted matter aggregation, eventually evolving into galaxies and clusters. The fluid term $-\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v})$ in the dynamic equation, assuming velocity $\mathbf{v} \propto -\nabla \rho$, reflects the flow of matter towards high-density regions, enhancing the positive feedback effect:

$$
-\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) \propto \nabla \cdot (\rho \nabla \rho) \approx \rho \nabla^2 \rho + (\nabla \rho)^2.
$$

Here, the $(\nabla \rho)^2$ term further amplifies density perturbations, analogous to the Jeans instability in cosmology, driving the transition of matter from a random distribution to an ordered structure.

### From Random Collisions to the Formation of Galaxies and Planets
Microscopic random collisions (e.g., scattering of quarks and photons) accumulate over time into macroscopic necessity through the positive feedback mechanism. In the early universe (~$10^{-35}$ seconds after the Big Bang), quantum fluctuations produced initial density perturbations, and Energy Quanta exchange (e.g., photons, gravitons) enhanced the density gradient in perturbed regions. Over time (~$10^9$ years), these perturbations, through positive feedback, formed gravitational potential wells, attracting gas clouds to collapse into primordial galaxies. Further gravitational aggregation within galaxies led to the formation of stellar and planetary systems. For instance, gas clouds collapsing under gravity release vast amounts of Energy Quanta (e.g., photons, thermal radiation), forming the cores of stars, while the remaining material forms protoplanetary disks under the influence of angular momentum.

This process embodies the transition from randomness to necessity. Random collisions at the microscopic scale (e.g., thermal motion of molecules) are disordered, but the positive feedback mechanism amplifies local perturbations through the density gradient, causing the system to tend towards stable, ordered configurations. For example, the formation of planetary systems is not random but a necessary consequence of gravitational potential wells and the conservation of angular momentum. The Theory of Energy Quanta provides a quantifiable physical mechanism for this process through the density gradient $\nabla \rho$ and the positive feedback term $k \rho^2$, revealing the microscopic roots of macroscopic necessity.

### Case Study: Galaxy Cluster Formation in the IllustrisTNG Simulation
The IllustrisTNG numerical simulation provides strong evidence for galaxy cluster formation driven by positive feedback mechanisms. This simulation, based on the standard cosmological model (ΛCDM), traces the evolution of matter from shortly after the Big Bang to the present day (~13.8 billion years), showing how initial density perturbations (~$10^{-5}$) are amplified by gravitational effects into galaxy clusters, filamentary structures, and void networks. The simulation results indicate that the positive feedback effect ($k \rho^2$) of the Energy Quanta density field enhances gravitational aggregation in high-density regions, while low-density regions become sparser due to the diffusion term $-D \nabla^2 \rho$, forming the large-scale structure of the universe.

Specifically, the IllustrisTNG simulation shows that initial perturbations form primordial galaxies within ~$10^7-10^8$ years and evolve into galaxy clusters within ~$10^9$ years. The formation of gravitational potential wells is consistent with the positive feedback term in the dynamic equation: high-density regions attract more Mass Quanta, the density gradient $\nabla \rho$ strengthens, leading to further aggregation. This process is irreversible, embodying the formation of macroscopic necessity. For instance, galaxy clusters in the simulation (e.g., with masses ~$10^{14}$ solar masses) form stable gravitational structures through positive feedback, and their spatial distribution (filaments, walls, voids) reflects the geometrized manifestation of density gradients. This case validates the core of the Theory of Energy Quanta: microscopic randomness is transformed into macroscopic necessity through positive feedback.

### Philosophical Implications: Necessity and Dialectics
The macroscopic necessity driven by the positive feedback mechanism offers profound philosophical insights. Hegel's dialectics proposed that the transformation from quantitative to qualitative change is the core mechanism of development. The Theory of Energy Quanta concretizes this principle through positive feedback ($k \rho^2$): minute perturbations (quantitative change) are transformed into ordered structures like galaxies and planets (qualitative change) through temporal accumulation and nonlinear amplification. For example, molecular clouds undergoing random collisions form stars through gravitational aggregation—a process from disorder to order that embodies the logic of dialectics.

Philosophically, the emergence of macroscopic necessity challenges the traditional opposition between determinism and randomness. Determinism assumed cosmic evolution was entirely determined by causal laws, overlooking the creativity of randomness; theories emphasizing randomness stressed contingency, neglecting the necessity of ordered structures. The Theory of Energy Quanta unifies these two through the positive feedback mechanism: microscopic randomness (e.g., quantum fluctuations) provides diversity, and positive feedback transforms random perturbations into necessary structures. This unification supports the view of process philosophy: the universe is a dynamic, generative system, where necessity emerges from randomness, with energetic dynamics as its core driving force.

### Summary
The positive feedback mechanism amplifies microscopic random perturbations through the $k \rho^2$ term in the dynamic equation, driving the formation of macroscopic structures like galaxies and planets, embodying the transition from randomness to necessity. The IllustrisTNG simulation validates this process, revealing the physical mechanisms of density gradients and positive feedback. Philosophically, macroscopic necessity aligns with the quantitative-qualitative change principle of dialectics, unifying randomness and necessity, and providing a theoretical basis for subsequent discussions on complexity and the fate of the universe.
