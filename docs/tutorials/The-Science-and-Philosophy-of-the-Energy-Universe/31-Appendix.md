## Mathematical Appendix: Derivation of Energy Quanta Density Gradient, Dynamic Equation Analysis, Quantum Correction Term

### 1. Derivation of the Energy Quanta Density Gradient
The Energy Quanta density field $\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$ represents the number density of Energy Quanta per unit volume. The force driving Mass Quanta aggregation originates from the density gradient $\nabla \rho$. In the Theory of Energy Quanta, it is assumed that the velocity of Mass Quanta $\mathbf{v}$ is proportional to the density gradient: $\mathbf{v} \propto -\nabla \rho$, reflecting the flow of Mass Quanta towards high-density regions. The derivation is as follows:

- The Mass Quanta current density is defined as $\mathbf{J} = \rho_m \mathbf{v}$, where $\rho_m$ is the Mass Quanta density.
- Assuming $\mathbf{v} = -\kappa \nabla \rho$, where $\kappa$ is a proportionality constant with units $\text{m}^2 \text{s}^{-1}$.
- The fluid term $-\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v})$ in the dynamic equation represents the contribution of Mass Quanta flow to the Energy Quanta density:

$$
-\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = -\nabla \cdot (-\kappa \rho \nabla \rho) = \kappa \nabla \cdot (\rho \nabla \rho) = \kappa \left( \rho \nabla^2 \rho + (\nabla \rho)^2 \right).
$$

  Here, $(\nabla \rho)^2$ enhances positive feedback, and $\rho \nabla^2 \rho$ describes diffusion effects.
- **Physical Significance**: The density gradient $\nabla \rho$ acts as a source of force (e.g., gravity, electromagnetic force), driving Mass Quanta aggregation and forming complex structures (e.g., galaxies, molecular networks).

### 2. Dynamic Equation Analysis
The core dynamic equation of the Theory of Energy Quanta is:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = k \rho^m - D \nabla^2 \rho - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) + S.
$$

Its components are analyzed as follows:

- **Positive Feedback Term $k \rho^m$**: Describes the nonlinear amplification of density perturbations, typically with $m=2$, reflecting exponential growth in high-density regions. The coefficient $k$ (units $\text{s}^{-1} \text{m}^{3(m-1)}$) determines the amplification rate. For example, in galaxy formation, initial perturbations (~$10^{-5}$) evolve into galaxy clusters through positive feedback.
- **Diffusion Term $-D \nabla^2 \rho$**: Describes the diffusion of Energy Quanta towards low-density regions. The coefficient $D$ (units $\text{m}^2 \text{s}^{-1}$) reflects the diffusion strength. The cosmic expansion driven by dark energy (~70 km/s/Mpc) can be viewed as a dominant effect of the diffusion term.
- **Fluid Term $-\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v})$**: Represents the flow of Mass Quanta along the density gradient, enhancing order in high-density regions. Combined with $\mathbf{v} \propto -\nabla \rho$, the fluid term introduces nonlinear coupling, driving complexity growth.
- **Quantum Correction Term $S$**: Introduces microscopic randomness, such as quantum fluctuations ($S \propto \hbar \nabla^2 \phi$, where $\phi$ is a scalar field). For instance, the quantum characteristics of gravitational waves (~10-100 Hz) can be modeled using this term.
- **Linearized Analysis**: Assuming $\rho = \rho_0 + \delta \rho$, the perturbation evolution equation is:

$$
\frac{\partial \delta \rho}{\partial t} \approx m k \rho_0^{m-1} \delta \rho - D \nabla^2 \delta \rho - \kappa \nabla \cdot (\rho_0 \nabla \delta \rho).
$$

  Assuming a plane wave perturbation $\delta \rho \propto e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)}$, the dispersion relation is:

$$
\omega \approx -i \left( m k \rho_0^{m-1} - D k^2 + \kappa \rho_0 k^2 \right).
$$

  When positive feedback dominates ($m k \rho_0^{m-1} > D k^2 + \kappa \rho_0 k^2$), perturbations grow exponentially, driving the formation of ordered structures; when diffusion dominates, perturbations decay, and the system tends towards homogeneity.

### 3. Quantum Correction Term
The quantum correction term $S \propto \hbar \nabla^2 \phi$ introduces the stochastic effects of quantum fluctuations, influencing evolution at microscopic scales. For example, quantum fluctuations in the early universe (~$10^{-5}$) were amplified by positive feedback into galactic structures, and Hawking radiation (~$10^{-12}$ eV) reflects quantum effects at the black hole event horizon. Deriving the influence of the quantum correction term:

- The Laplacian $\nabla^2 \phi$ of the scalar field $\phi$ describes local variations due to quantum fluctuations, with $\hbar$ introducing the quantum scale (~$10^{-34}$ JÂ·s).
- In black hole evaporation, the quantum correction term drives the generation of Energy Quanta pairs (particle-antiparticle), leading to mass loss (evaporation time $t_{\text{evap}} \propto \frac{G^2 M^3}{\hbar c^4}$).
- In consciousness research, the quantum correction term might describe microscopic randomness in neural networks (e.g., synaptic noise), influencing the emergence of complex functions.

## Observations and Experiments: Latest Advances in Gravitational Waves, CMB, Dark Matter/Dark Energy Detection

1. **Gravitational Waves (LIGO)**:
   LIGO detects gravitational waves (frequency ~10-100 Hz) from black hole mergers, validating the prediction of low-frequency Energy Quanta (e.g., gravitons) in the Theory of Energy Quanta. The first detection in 2015 (GW150914) showed that a binary black hole merger (masses ~36+29 solar masses) released gravitational waves with energy equivalent to about 3 solar masses, consistent with positive feedback (gravitational aggregation) and the quantum correction term (quantum characteristics of gravitational waves) in the dynamic equation. Future LIGO upgrades (sensitivity improved to ~$10^{-24}$ strain) could detect lower-frequency signals, verifying the microscopic properties of gravitons.

2. **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB, Planck)**:
   Planck 2018 data measured the temperature fluctuations of the CMB (~$10^{-5}$), revealing the amplification process of early universe quantum fluctuations, consistent with the prediction of the positive feedback term $k \rho^2$ in the dynamic equation. CMB data indicate a flat universe (curvature parameter $\Omega_k \approx 0$) with dark energy comprising ~70% of the energy density, supporting accelerated expansion driven by the diffusion term $-D \nabla^2 \rho$. Future CMB experiments (e.g., Simons Observatory) can further precisely measure polarization signals, verifying the cosmological predictions of the Theory of Energy Quanta.

3. **Dark Matter/Dark Energy Detection (Euclid, DESI)**:
   The Euclid telescope (launched 2022) measures the properties of dark energy (equation of state parameter $w \approx -1$) through weak gravitational lensing and galaxy distribution, verifying the diffusion effect of extremely low-frequency Energy Quanta (~$10^{-33}$ Hz). DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) studies the history of cosmic expansion through redshift measurements (~$10^9$ galaxies). Preliminary data (2024) support an approximately constant dark energy density. The diffusion term in the dynamic equation can simulate the expansive effect of dark energy; future data can constrain the parameter $D$, verifying the predictions of the Theory of Energy Quanta.
