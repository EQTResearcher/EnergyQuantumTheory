## Section 7.1: The Phenomenon-Driven Scientific Method

The Theory of Energy Quanta, through the dynamic interaction of Energy Quanta and Mass Quanta, proposes a phenomenon-driven scientific method, emphasizing the construction of theories from observable phenomena to reveal the evolutionary laws of the universe from the micro to the macro scale. This section explores the analogy between the Energy Quanta/Mass Quanta periodic table and Mendeleev's periodic table of elements, analyzes the methodology for predicting new particles (e.g., medium-frequency and extremely low-frequency Energy Quanta), and, by integrating the potential for experimental verification from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), gravitational wave detection (LIGO), and the Euclid telescope, elucidates the philosophy of science significance of the phenomenon-driven method, highlighting the inspiration the Theory of Energy Quanta provides for interdisciplinary research.

### Analogy Between the Energy Quanta/Mass Quanta Periodic Table and Mendeleev's Periodic Table
Mendeleev's periodic table revealed the regularity of material structure through the chemical properties and atomic weights of elements, providing a framework for predicting new elements (e.g., gallium, germanium). Similarly, the Theory of Energy Quanta proposes an Energy Quanta/Mass Quanta periodic table, classifying fundamental cosmic components based on Energy Quanta frequency (from high-frequency gamma rays ~$10^{19}$ Hz to extremely low-frequency dark energy ~$10^{-33}$ Hz) and Mass Quanta properties (e.g., quarks, electrons), revealing the laws governing their dynamic interactions. The dynamic equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = k \rho^m - D \nabla^2 \rho - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) + S,
$$

describes the evolution of the Energy Quanta density field $\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)$, where the positive feedback term $k \rho^2$ and the quantum correction term $S \propto \hbar \nabla^2 \phi$ reflect the interactive characteristics of Energy Quanta and Mass Quanta.

The analogy lies in their predictive power. Mendeleev predicted new elements based on gaps in his table; the Theory of Energy Quanta predicts new particles based on frequency ranges and interactive characteristics. For instance, high-frequency Energy Quanta (e.g., photons, ~$10^{14}-10^{19}$ Hz) correspond to electromagnetic interactions, low-frequency Energy Quanta (e.g., gravitons, ~$10^{-12}$ Hz) correspond to gravitational interactions, and extremely low-frequency Energy Quanta (~$10^{-33}$ Hz) might be related to dark energy. This classification is based on observable phenomena (e.g., photon scattering, gravitational waves), deducing the existence of new particles through the dynamic equation, thereby providing direction for experimental verification.

### Methodology for Predicting New Particles: Medium-Frequency and Extremely Low-Frequency Energy Quanta
The phenomenon-driven scientific method emphasizes starting from observed phenomena and using the dynamic equation to predict new particles. The Theory of Energy Quanta proposes that medium-frequency Energy Quanta (~$10^{-4}-10^{10}$ Hz) and extremely low-frequency Energy Quanta (~$10^{-33}-10^{-4}$ Hz) might exist, corresponding to unknown interactions and dark energy mechanisms, respectively. The predictive methodology includes:

- **Frequency Analysis**: The frequency of an Energy Quantum determines its interactive characteristics. Medium-frequency Energy Quanta might lie between electromagnetic force (photons) and weak interaction (W/Z bosons), influencing particle decay or chemical reactions. For example, the quantum correction term $S$ in the dynamic equation might contain effects of medium-frequency Energy Quanta, altering the probability distribution of particle interactions.
- **Dynamic Balance**: The positive feedback term $k \rho^2$ and the diffusion term $-D \nabla^2 \rho$ describe the dynamic interaction between Energy Quanta and Mass Quanta. Extremely low-frequency Energy Quanta (e.g., dark energy) drive cosmic expansion through the diffusion term, and their properties can be deduced from parameters in the dynamic equation (e.g., $D$ or $w$).
- **Observability**: Predictions of new particles require experimental verification. For instance, medium-frequency Energy Quanta might produce anomalous signals in high-energy particle collisions (e.g., at the LHC), while extremely low-frequency Energy Quanta might be indirectly detected through cosmological observations (e.g., with the Euclid telescope).

This methodology starts with phenomena (e.g., gravitational waves, CMB fluctuations), constructs theoretical models via the dynamic equation, and predicts verifiable particles or effects, embodying the philosophy of science of the phenomenon-driven approach.

### Case Studies: Verification Potential of LHC, LIGO, and Euclid Experiments

1. **LHC (Large Hadron Collider)**: The LHC probes for new particles through high-energy particle collisions (energy ~14 TeV), such as the Higgs boson (discovered in 2012). The Theory of Energy Quanta predicts that medium-frequency Energy Quanta might cause anomalous decay or scattering events within specific energy ranges (e.g., ~$10^{-4}-10^{10}$ Hz). For instance, the positive feedback term $k \rho^2$ in the dynamic equation might describe the production of new particles, which the LHC could verify through anomalous jet events or missing energy signals.
2. **LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory)**: LIGO detects gravitational waves (frequency ~10-100 Hz) from black hole mergers, corresponding to low-frequency Energy Quanta (potential gravitons). The Theory of Energy Quanta proposes that the quantum characteristics of gravitational waves (the $S \propto \hbar \nabla^2 \phi$ term in the dynamic equation) might reveal new interaction mechanisms. Future upgrades to LIGO could increase its sensitivity to detect even lower-frequency signals.
3. **Euclid Telescope**: The Euclid mission aims to precisely determine the properties of dark energy (~$10^{-33}$ Hz) by measuring galaxy distributions and weak gravitational lensing effects. The diffusion term $-D \nabla^2 \rho$ in the dynamic equation describes the expansive effect of dark energy. Euclid can verify its equation of state ($w \approx -1$ or dynamic variation), providing data on the nature of extremely low-frequency Energy Quanta.

These experiments validate the effectiveness of the phenomenon-driven method: starting from observable phenomena (e.g., particle collisions, gravitational waves, cosmic expansion), predicting new particles or effects through the dynamic equation, and thereby driving theoretical development.

### Philosophical Implications: Phenomenon-Driven Approach and Theoretical Innovation
The phenomenon-driven scientific method offers profound philosophical insights:

1. **Epistemology**: The Theory of Energy Quanta constructs its dynamic equation from phenomena (e.g., gravitational waves, CMB), emphasizing theoretical innovation grounded in observable data. Compared to traditional theory-driven hypotheses (e.g., string theory), the phenomenon-driven method is closer to experimental verification, reflecting the openness of the scientific method.
2. **Philosophy of Science**: The analogy of the Energy Quanta/Mass Quanta periodic table reveals science's capacity for pattern discovery, similar to the predictive power of Mendeleev's periodic table. This method, integrating phenomena and theory, transcends mere induction or deduction, embodying the dialectical nature of scientific progress.
3. **Interdisciplinary Significance**: The Theory of Energy Quanta unifies physics, chemistry, and biology through the dynamic equation. The methodology for predicting new particles can be extended to the study of complex systems (e.g., neural networks, ecosystems), providing a framework for interdisciplinary research.

### Summary
The phenomenon-driven scientific method predicts new particles (e.g., medium-frequency and extremely low-frequency Energy Quanta) through the Energy Quanta/Mass Quanta periodic table, based on the dynamic equation and integrated with the verification potential of LHC, LIGO, and Euclid experiments, revealing the laws of cosmic evolution. Philosophically, this method deepens epistemology, emphasizes the dialectical unity of phenomenon and theory, and provides an open framework for interdisciplinary application and the exploration of ultimate cosmic questions.
