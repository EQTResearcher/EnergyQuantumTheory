This monograph, centered on the Theory of Energy Quanta, aims to construct a framework that unifies physics and philosophy, exploring the fundamental laws governing the universe's ontology, evolution, and ultimate fate. The Theory of Energy Quanta stems from a systematic re-examination of basic cosmic phenomenaâ€”particles, forces, and structure formation. It proposes energy as the sole fundamental substance of the universe, driven by the dynamic interaction between Mass Quanta and Energy Quanta, which propels all complex evolution, from microscopic random collisions to the formation of macroscopic galaxies. This theory not only attempts to unify the four fundamental forces (strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational) and their potential extensions (such as forces related to dark matter and dark energy) but also, by redefining time and space (time as a measure of energy change, space as a measure of energy intensity), offers a novel and transformative cosmic perspective for philosophy.

Core questions permeate the entire work: Can the universe be ultimately understood as a dynamic expression of energy? How do time and space emerge from the exchange of Energy Quanta and the aggregation of Mass Quanta? Does the growth of cosmic complexity have a limit, or does it achieve a dynamic balance within energy cycles? These questions are pertinent not only to a unified theory in physics but also touch upon fundamental philosophical inquiries: the nature of existence, process, complexity, and cosmic destiny.

The innovation of the Theory of Energy Quanta lies in the following points:

1. **Energy Monism**: Utilizing Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula $E = mc^2$ and Planck's relation $\Delta E = hf$, it unifies Mass Quanta (e.g., quarks, leptons) and Energy Quanta (e.g., photons, potential gravitons) as different forms of energy, transcending traditional matter-spirit dualism.
2. **Dynamic Definitions of Time and Space**: Defining time as a measure of energy change and space as a manifestation of energy density gradients challenges Newton's absolute and Einstein's relative views of spacetime, emphasizing the dynamic nature of the universe.
3. **Periodic Table Paradigm**: Proposing periodic tables for Energy Quanta and Mass Quanta, classified by frequency (or equivalent frequency), to predict new particles, continuing the phenomenon-driven tradition of science.
4. **Density Gradient Mechanism**: Forces (particularly gravity) originate from the tendency of energy quanta density gradients $\nabla \rho$ to homogenize, unifying microscopic (quantum exchange) and macroscopic (galaxy formation) phenomena.
5. **Nonlinear Evolution and Complexity**: Positive feedback mechanisms drive the transition from microscopic randomness to macroscopic necessity, creating a dialectical balance between local entropy decrease and global entropy increase, revealing the emergent logic of cosmic complexity.

The monograph's structure progresses logically from physical foundations to philosophical implications:

- **Chapter 1** establishes Energy Monism, exploring the possibility of energy as the cosmic substance.
- **Chapter 2** redefines time and space, revealing their nature as dynamic attributes of energy.
- **Chapter 3** analyzes the unification of microscopic randomness and macroscopic necessity, explaining the driving mechanisms of positive feedback.
- **Chapter 4** explores the dialectical relationship between global chaos and local order, revealing the emergence of complex systems.
- **Chapter 5** focuses on nonlinear evolution and the irreversibility of time, challenging the limitations of reductionism.
- **Chapter 6** looks toward the limits of complexity and the fate of the universe, discussing energy cycles and dynamic equilibrium.
- **Chapter 7** examines the contributions of the Theory of Energy Quanta to the philosophy of science from epistemological and methodological perspectives.

## Interdisciplinary Significance
The Theory of Energy Quanta is not merely an attempt at unification in physics but also a revolutionary exploration in philosophy. It connects particle physics (Standard Model), cosmology (galaxy formation, dark energy), complex systems science (life, consciousness), and philosophy (monism, process philosophy). Through its phenomenon-driven periodic table predictions and quantifiable density gradient mechanisms, the theory provides guidance for the discovery of new particles and the exploration of cosmic destiny; through its dynamic view of time and space and the logic of complexity evolution, it injects new vitality into metaphysics and the philosophy of science.
