Within the fundamental framework of quantum mechanics, the traditional classification of elementary particles into bosons and fermions in the Standard Model may obscure a more essential physical reality: the fundamental distinction between energy and mass. Reexamining the quantum world from the perspective of energy quanta and mass quanta can not only reveal the deeper significance of Planck's formula but may also provide new insights for understanding unsolved mysteries such as the graviton.

## Bosons, Fermions, and the Need for a New Classification

The Standard Model classifies particles into bosons and fermions based on spin-statistics. Although mathematically rigorous, this classification lacks somewhat in physical intuitiveness. Photons, as bosons, have no rest mass and propagate at the speed of light; whereas fermions like electrons possess rest mass and move at speeds less than light. This essential difference suggests that we should perhaps reconstruct the cognitive framework of the quantum world using the concepts of energy quanta and mass quanta.

## Energy Quanta: Photons and Beyond

The typical representative of energy quanta is the photon, whose most notable characteristics are the absence of rest mass and propagation at the speed of light. Planck's formula, `E = hν`, accurately describes the fundamental properties of such energy quanta, directly linking energy to frequency. This formula applies not only to photons in electromagnetic interactions but its conceptual framework can also be extended to other quantum phenomena involving massless entities. The recent detection of gravitational waves, confirming their propagation at light speed, provides strong support for including the graviton within the category of energy quanta.

## Mass Quanta: Fermions and the Schrödinger Equation

Mass quanta are represented by fermions such as electrons, which possess rest mass and constitute the material world we perceive daily. The behavior of these particles is more suitably described by the Schrödinger equation, whose wave function evolution reflects the probabilistic nature of the quantum world. The motion speed of mass quanta is always less than the speed of light, forming a sharp contrast with the light-speed propagation of energy quanta.

## The Anthropic Principle and Cognitive Bias

From an epistemological perspective, human familiarity with mass quanta far exceeds that with energy quanta, likely stemming from cognitive preferences formed during our evolution in the macroscopic world. This influence of the "anthropic principle" has led to the Schrödinger equation occupying a more prominent position in quantum theory, while the fundamental significance of Planck's formula has been relatively undervalued.

## Energy Quanta, Mass Quanta, and Mass-Energy Equivalence

Classifying particles into energy quanta and mass quanta not only aligns better with the profound insight of Einstein's mass-energy equivalence but can also provide new perspectives for the development of quantum gravity theory. If gravitons indeed exist and belong to energy quanta, then Planck's formula could become an important bridge connecting different interactions. This classification suggests that the "first principles" of the quantum world might not be a single mathematical expression but rather a theoretical system jointly constituted by Planck's formula describing energy quanta and the Schrödinger equation describing mass quanta.

## Breaking Through Traditional Classifications

The further development of modern physics requires breaking through the limitations of traditional classifications. The division into energy quanta and mass quanta not only offers conceptual clarity but may also guide new research directions. For instance, in quantum field theory, this classification could help us understand the essential characteristics of different particles more clearly, particularly providing new avenues in the quest to unify the four fundamental interactions.

## Historical Parallels and Theoretical Evolution

The advancement of scientific theory often accompanies the reselection of fundamental premises. This is evidenced by the astronomical revolution from geocentrism to heliocentrism, and the development of quantum theory from Planck's formula to the Schrödinger equation. The conceptual division into energy quanta and mass quanta might indeed be a crucial step toward a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics.

## The Importance of an Open Theoretical Perspective

On the path to exploring the quantum world, maintaining an open theoretical perspective is more important than adhering to established frameworks. The classification into energy quanta and mass quanta is not merely a reorganization of existing knowledge but a beneficial outlook on the future development of physics. With advances in experimental technology and deeper theoretical research, this perspective may lead us to a more profound understanding of the quantum essence.
