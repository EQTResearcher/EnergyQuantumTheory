# Phenomenon-Driven Progress and Theoretical Evolution: The Quantum Path from Planck to Schrödinger

The development of physics has consistently followed a phenomenon-driven tradition. The establishment of quantum mechanics perfectly exemplifies this principle: from Planck's energy quantization to de Broglie's matter wave hypothesis, and finally to Schrödinger's wave mechanics—each theoretical breakthrough was deeply rooted in understanding specific experimental phenomena.

## Planck's Formula and Energy Quantization

Planck's formula emerged from the "ultraviolet catastrophe" in blackbody radiation experiments. This seemingly simple mathematical expression `E = hν` contained a revolutionary physical concept: energy transfer occurs in discrete quantum units. Although Planck initially regarded it merely as a mathematical solution to a specific problem, this formula actually revealed nature's most fundamental energy quantization phenomenon. Particularly significant is how this formula accurately describes the basic characteristics of energy quanta like photons, establishing a solid foundation for subsequent theoretical development.

## De Broglie's Matter Wave Hypothesis

Building upon Planck's work, de Broglie made a crucial advancement. Inspired by the wave-particle duality of photons, he extended the wave concept to all material particles, proposing the famous matter wave hypothesis `λ = h/p`. This theoretical innovation not only explained electron diffraction phenomena but, more importantly, expanded the quantization concept from the energy domain to the material realm, constructing a theoretical bridge connecting energy quanta and material particles.

## The Schrödinger Equation: A Unified Framework

The formulation of the Schrödinger equation marked the maturation of quantum mechanics' theoretical framework. Based on de Broglie's matter wave concept, Schrödinger developed a wave equation describing quantum system evolution. The key reason this equation could supersede Planck's formula as quantum mechanics' core equation lies in its exceptional universality. It can address both energy quanta problems and perfectly describe the quantum behavior of massive particles, providing a unified theoretical framework for understanding complex phenomena like atomic structure and molecular bonding.

## The Pattern of Scientific Evolution

This theoretical development process demonstrates the fundamental pattern of scientific evolution: starting from specific experimental phenomena, through continuous abstraction and generalization, eventually forming a theoretical framework with broad explanatory power. While Planck's formula possesses groundbreaking significance, its applicability remains primarily limited to energy quantization phenomena. In contrast, the Schrödinger equation, with its powerful universality, has become the central pillar of quantum mechanical theory.

## Epistemological Perspectives and Cognitive Bias

From an epistemological perspective, this shift in theoretical emphasis also reflects characteristics of human cognition. We find it easier to understand and study particles with rest mass because they constitute the familiar material world. This cognitive preference has granted the Schrödinger equation a more prominent position in quantum theory, while somewhat overshadowing the fundamental significance of Planck's formula.

## Reexamining Fundamental Concepts

Modern physics development is prompting reexamination of these basic concepts. The discovery of gravitational waves and their light-speed propagation characteristics provides new evidence for understanding gravitons as energy quanta. Should this understanding be further confirmed, the fundamental status of Planck's formula may require reassessment. The classification framework of energy quanta and mass quanta might offer a clearer theoretical perspective.

## Balancing Tradition and Innovation

In exploring the quantum world, we must both respect the phenomenon-driven scientific tradition and maintain openness to theoretical innovation. The development of quantum theory from Planck to Schrödinger demonstrates that scientific progress requires both solid experimental foundations and the theoretical courage to break through conventional frameworks. With expanding research horizons and advancing experimental technology, our understanding of quantum phenomena will undoubtedly reach new heights.
