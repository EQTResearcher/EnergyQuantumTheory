The development of quantum mechanics reveals a profound epistemological issue: our understanding of physical theories is inevitably constrained by the limitations of human observational capabilities. The anthropic principle provides a unique perspective for understanding the relationship between Planck's formula and the Schrödinger equation.

## Planck's Formula and the Concept of Energy Quanta

The proposal of Planck's formula `E = hν` in 1900 marked humanity's first direct encounter with the concept of energy quanta. This formula specifically describes the behavior of quanta like photons, which carry energy while having no rest mass. However, because human senses and instruments are better adapted to detecting ordinary matter with mass, our understanding of energy quanta such as photons has always remained limited. Photons are neither classical particles nor pure waves, and their quantum characteristics often exceed the scope of our intuitive understanding.

## The Anthropic Principle and Cognitive Bias

From the perspective of the anthropic principle, this cognitive bias has profound causes. The perceptual systems developed through human evolution in the macroscopic world are naturally more adept at handling the motion laws of particles with mass. We can relatively easily observe the behavior of tangible matter like electrons and atoms, yet struggle to directly comprehend energy quanta such as photons. This difference in observational capability directly influences our judgment about the importance of physical theories.

## Limitations of Planck's Formula

Although Planck's formula accurately describes the fundamental characteristics of energy quanta, its scope of application remains relatively limited. Initially proposed to solve the specific problem of blackbody radiation, it represented more of an empirical mathematical fit than a universal theoretical framework. Despite revealing the core concept of energy quantization, it failed to provide complete tools for describing the dynamic evolution of quantum systems.

## The Schrödinger Equation: A Universal Framework

In contrast, the Schrödinger equation established a more universal theoretical framework. This equation not only incorporated Planck's concept of energy quantization but also integrated de Broglie's wave-particle duality concept, forming a mathematical tool capable of describing the behavior of various quantum systems. The superiority of the Schrödinger equation lies in its ability to address problems involving both energy quanta like photons and perfectly describe the quantum behavior of particles with mass like electrons.

## Dual Significance of the Anthropic Principle

The anthropic principle here demonstrates dual significance:

- On one hand, it explains why we more easily understand and accept the Schrödinger equation, because this framework better connects with our intuitive understanding of matter with mass.
- On the other hand, it reminds us that the world of energy quanta described by Planck's formula might contain more fundamental physical laws, which haven't received sufficient attention due to our observational limitations.

## Influence of Human Cognitive Characteristics

The history of quantum mechanics development shows that the choice of mathematical tools depends not only on theoretical completeness but is also influenced by human cognitive characteristics. The reason why the Schrödinger equation is regarded as a first principle stems both from its mathematical completeness and its better alignment with human cognitive habits. However, this doesn't mean that the energy quantization concept revealed by Planck's formula is less fundamental.

## Quantum Field Theory and Planck's Legacy

The development of modern quantum field theory has further deepened this understanding. In quantum electrodynamics, the description of photons requires more complex mathematical tools, yet the core idea of Planck's formula still plays a fundamental role. This suggests that the importance of different mathematical frameworks may change with the expansion of our understanding's depth and breadth.

## Philosophical Reflections on Quantum Mechanics

From a philosophical perspective, the evolution process of quantum mechanics reflects humanity's unique path in understanding nature: we always start from the most easily observable phenomena, gradually construct theoretical frameworks, and then explore those domains that are difficult to perceive directly. This process demonstrates both the power of human reason and its inherent limitations.

## Conclusion

On the path to exploring the quantum world, maintaining clear awareness of our cognitive limitations might be more important than debating which formula is more fundamental. Genuine scientific progress often comes from our ability to transcend our observational limitations and understand physical realities that appear counterintuitive.
