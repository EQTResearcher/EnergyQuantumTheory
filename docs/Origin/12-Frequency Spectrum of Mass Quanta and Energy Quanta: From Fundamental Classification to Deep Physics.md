Through detailed analysis of elementary particle frequencies, we discover clear demarcation laws within the frequency spectrum. When using `10²⁰` Hertz and `10²⁶` Hertz as boundaries, the particle world reveals three distinct regions, each possessing unique physical characteristics.

## Low-Frequency Region (<10²⁰ Hertz): Domain of Energy Quanta

Within this frequency range, we find typical characteristics of energy quanta. Photons exhibit a broad frequency distribution from `10⁶` Hertz radio waves to `10²⁰` Hertz X-rays in this region. Low-frequency photons possess longer wavelengths, enabling them to propagate on cosmic scales, making them crucial tools for human long-distance communication and astronomical observation. Hypothetical gravitons also reside in this region, with their `10²` to `10¹⁰` Hertz frequency range highly consistent with detected gravitational wave properties. Particularly noteworthy is the appearance of neutrinos in this region at approximately `1.21×10¹³` Hertz. Although possessing extremely small rest mass, their frequency characteristics more closely resemble energy quanta. Particles in this region generally exhibit massless or minimal mass properties, propagate at light speed, and their interaction ranges typically extend to great distances.

## Transition Region (10²⁰–10²⁶ Hertz): Convergence of Mass and Energy

This frequency interval displays rich physical phenomena and represents a key area for understanding the particle world. Electrons appear at the lower end of this region with a frequency of `1.24×10²⁰` Hertz, while fundamental fermions like up quarks and down quarks distribute across the range of `5.32×10²⁰` Hertz to `1.14×10²¹` Hertz. As frequency increases, we encounter particles such as muons, strange quarks, charm quarks, and tau leptons, with their frequencies distributed between `10²²` and `10²³` Hertz.

The most striking feature of this region is the concentrated appearance of W bosons, Z bosons, and the Higgs boson. W bosons have a frequency of `1.94×10²⁵` Hertz, Z bosons `2.21×10²⁵` Hertz, while the Higgs boson occupies a significant position at `3.02×10²⁵` Hertz. The proximity of these particles' frequencies, all located at the high-frequency end of the transition region, is no coincidence. The appearance of the Higgs boson in this specific frequency interval carries profound physical significance as the carrier of mass origin. It serves as a bridge connecting the massless world of energy quanta and the massive world of mass quanta.

## High-Frequency Region (>10²⁶ Hertz): Frontier of Mass Quanta

In the region above `10²⁶` Hertz, known particles from the Standard Model do not appear. This vacant region may indicate new physical laws awaiting discovery. Theoretical expectations suggest this region should be occupied by particles with greater rest masses, following the fundamental characteristics of mass quanta: possessing definite rest mass, moving at speeds less than light, with interaction ranges decreasing as mass increases.

## Deep Interpretation of Physical Connotations

This frequency distribution pattern reveals a fundamental characteristic of nature: intrinsic connections exist between particle frequencies and their physical properties. In the low-frequency region, energy quanta directly embody the essence of energy quantization through Planck's formula `E = hν`; in the transition region, Einstein's mass-energy equation `E = mc²` and Planck's formula interact through `ν = mc²/h` to link mass with frequency; while in the high-frequency region, this relationship will persist, awaiting new particle discoveries to enrich this theoretical framework.

Particularly deserving of in-depth exploration is the special position of the Higgs boson in the transition region. Its frequency position (`3.02×10²⁵` Hertz) precisely coincides with the critical point where mass quanta begin to dominate, perfectly matching its function of endowing other particles with mass. Through the Higgs mechanism, originally massless particles acquire mass, thus transitioning from energy quanta characteristics to mass quanta characteristics. W and Z bosons serve as perfect examples of this process—they acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, enabling them to exist stably within specific frequency ranges.

## Connection Between Frequency and Interaction Range

This frequency classification also closely relates to particle interaction ranges. In the low-frequency region, particles' long-wavelength characteristics enable them to function across large scales; in the transition region, as frequency increases, particle interaction ranges gradually decrease; while in the anticipated high-frequency region, particle interaction ranges will further diminish, consistent with fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.

## Implications for Future Research

The discovery of this frequency spectrum provides new directions for particle physics research. The transition region, particularly the frequency zone around `10²⁵` Hertz, is clearly crucial for understanding mass origin. Meanwhile, the vacancy in the high-frequency region suggests the possible existence of new particles beyond the Standard Model. Future high-energy physics experiments should perhaps pay special attention to these frequency boundary regions, where nature's deeper secrets may be hidden.

This frequency-based particle classification method not only provides new perspectives for understanding elementary particles but may also become a bridge connecting quantum mechanics and gravitational theory. Within this framework, we can more clearly see how nature constructs the diverse particle world through simple mathematical laws—from Planck's formula to Einstein's equations.
