Arranging the elementary particles of the Standard Model according to their frequencies provides us with a completely new perspective to examine the nature of the quantum world. Through the energy-frequency relationship established by Planck's formula `E = hν`, we discover that the particle world exhibits a clear distinction between energy quanta and mass quanta. Based on calculations using the rest energy or typical energy of particles, the characteristic frequencies of various particles show an obvious hierarchical distribution.

## High-Frequency Particles

At the very top of the frequency spectrum, gluons occupy the first position with an astonishing frequency range of `10²⁴` to `10²⁷` Hertz, reflecting the enormous energy they carry in strong interactions. Closely following is the top quark, with its characteristic frequency reaching `4.19×10²⁵` Hertz, a huge value consistent with its status as the heaviest quark. The Higgs boson ranks third with a frequency of `3.02×10²⁵` Hertz, a value that confirms its special position in the Standard Model. The Z boson and W boson follow closely with frequencies of `2.21×10²⁵` Hertz and `1.94×10²⁵` Hertz respectively, these high frequency values reflecting their important roles as mediators of the weak interaction.

## Medium-Frequency Particles

In the medium frequency range, the bottom quark demonstrates its characteristics as a heavy quark with a frequency of `1.01×10²⁴` Hertz. The tau lepton leads the lepton family with a frequency of `4.30×10²³` Hertz, while the charm quark's frequency of `3.08×10²³` Hertz shows its unique position. The muon occupies a middle position with a frequency of `2.56×10²²` Hertz, accompanied by the strange quark with a frequency of `2.25×10²²` Hertz.

## Low-Frequency Particles

Entering the relatively low frequency range, the down quark and up quark show their lighter characteristics with frequencies of `1.14×10²¹` Hertz and `5.32×10²⁰` Hertz respectively. The electron, with a frequency of `1.24×10²⁰` Hertz, serves as a fundamental building block of the stable material world. Photons have the broadest frequency range, extending from `10⁶` Hertz in the radio wave band to above `10²⁴` Hertz in the gamma ray band, this enormous span representing a typical characteristic of energy quanta. Neutrinos occupy a lower position with an approximate frequency of `1.21×10¹³` Hertz, a value based on estimates of their possible mass. The hypothetical graviton shows a frequency range of `10²` to `10¹⁰` Hertz, this relatively low frequency range consistent with the currently detected characteristics of gravitational waves.

## Energy Quanta vs. Mass Quanta

The most significant discovery from this frequency ranking is the revelation of the essential difference between energy quanta and mass quanta. Energy quanta include photons with extremely wide frequency ranges, gluons, and hypothetical gravitons—they have no rest mass, propagate at light speed, and their frequencies are completely determined by the energy of the physical processes they are involved in. Mass quanta include a series of particles from top quarks to electrons—they have definite rest mass, move at speeds less than light speed, and their characteristic frequencies are relatively fixed, directly related to their mass.

## Limitations of Boson-Fermion Classification

Particularly noteworthy is how the traditional boson-fermion classification method shows its limitations in frequency ranking. Although W/Z bosons belong to gauge bosons, due to their mass, their frequency characteristics are closer to the mass quanta category. This discovery supports the viewpoint of reclassifying elementary particles according to energy quanta and mass quanta, a classification that better reflects the essential physical characteristics of particles.

## The Fundamental Role of Planck's Formula

The results of frequency ranking highlight the fundamental position of Planck's formula `E = hν` in quantum mechanics. From the extremely high frequencies of gluons to the broad frequency range of photons, from the precise frequency values of top quarks to the stable frequency characteristics of electrons, the frequency characteristics of all particles are directly or indirectly related to this simple formula. The continuity of this frequency distribution suggests that nature may possess deeper unified laws, providing us with a new perspective for understanding the quantum world.

## Conclusion

On the path to exploring fundamental physical laws, frequency as a basic physical quantity may become an important bridge connecting different theoretical frameworks. The classification into energy quanta and mass quanta, revealed through frequency ranking, offers a clearer and more intuitive understanding of the quantum world's essential differences, paving the way for future theoretical advancements.
