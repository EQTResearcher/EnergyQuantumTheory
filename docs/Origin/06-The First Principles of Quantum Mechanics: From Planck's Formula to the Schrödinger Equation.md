The development of quantum mechanics has persistently provoked deep thought: what constitutes the first principle of this theoretical system? Is it Planck's formula that initiated the quantum era, or the Schrödinger equation that constructed the complete theoretical framework? Exploring this question not only concerns historical context but also touches the essence of quantum mechanics.

## Planck's Formula and the Birth of Quantum Theory

The proposal of Planck's formula (E = hν) in 1900 marked the birth of quantum theory. To explain blackbody radiation experiments, Planck hypothesized that energy is transmitted in discrete "quanta." However, this groundbreaking insight was initially regarded more as a mathematical tool to solve specific problems, with its profound physical implications not yet fully recognized. Although Planck's formula revealed the phenomenon of energy quantization, it failed to provide a complete framework for describing the motion of microscopic particles.

## De Broglie's Hypothesis and Wave-Particle Duality

De Broglie's hypothesis (λ = h/p) in 1924 extended wave-particle duality from photons to all material particles, representing a significant leap in theoretical development. Building upon Planck's energy quantization, this hypothesis further proposed the concept of matter waves, paving the way for the establishment of wave mechanics. Nevertheless, de Broglie's work remained at the conceptual level, lacking specific mathematical formulation.

## The Schrödinger Equation: A Complete Framework

It was the introduction of the Schrödinger equation in 1926 that truly constructed the complete theoretical system of quantum mechanics. This partial differential equation, based on the concept of wave function, not only possesses elegant mathematical form but, more importantly, provides a framework for practical calculation and prediction. The Schrödinger equation perfectly integrates Planck's quantization concept with de Broglie's wave-particle duality, forming the core equation describing the motion laws of microscopic particles.

## Characteristics of the Schrödinger Equation

From the perspective of first principles, the Schrödinger equation exhibits several key characteristics:

- **Universality**: It is capable of describing behaviors of various non-relativistic quantum systems.
- **Fundamentality**: Many important conclusions in quantum mechanics can be derived from it.
- **Completeness**: It provides a complete theoretical framework rather than merely a solution to a specific problem.

## Limitations of Planck's Formula and De Broglie's Hypothesis

In contrast, although Planck's formula has groundbreaking significance, its scope of application is relatively limited, serving more as an empirical formula addressing the specific phenomenon of blackbody radiation. De Broglie's hypothesis acts as an important theoretical bridge, extending quantum concepts from the radiation domain to the material domain, yet it never formed a complete theoretical system.

## Assumptions and Experimental Verification

Notably, the Schrödinger equation itself is also built upon several basic assumptions, including the concept of wave function and its statistical interpretation. The validity of these assumptions ultimately requires experimental verification, which again confirms the distinction between mathematical tools and physical reality. The establishment process of quantum mechanics demonstrates that a complete theoretical system requires both profound physical insight and rigorous mathematical formulation.

## The Role of the Schrödinger Equation in Modern Quantum Mechanics

The development of modern quantum mechanics proves that the Schrödinger equation has indeed assumed the role of a first principle. It can not only explain known quantum phenomena but also predict new quantum effects, laying the foundation for subsequent developments in quantum field theory and quantum statistics. This process also reveals that the evolution of scientific theories often progresses from the discovery of local regularities to the establishment of universal theoretical frameworks.
