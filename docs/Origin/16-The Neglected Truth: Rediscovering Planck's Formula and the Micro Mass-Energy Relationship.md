In the history of physics, Planck's formula `E = hν` proposed in 1900 should have initiated a cognitive revolution, yet its profound significance remained obscured for a long time. This formula, born five years earlier than Einstein's mass-energy equation, not only solved the blackbody radiation problem but also contained profound implications for micro mass-energy relationships. This neglected truth is only now being fully revealed through Energy Quanta Theory (EQT).

## Historical Reexamination: The Confined Planck's Formula

The birth of Planck's formula originated from the need to explain blackbody radiation phenomena. When classical physics faced the "ultraviolet catastrophe" dilemma, Planck's energy quantization hypothesis shattered traditional understanding. However, this revolutionary idea faced widespread skepticism at the time, with even Planck himself considering it merely a mathematical tool for solving specific problems, failing to recognize its universal physical significance.

Historical development shows that the scientific community narrowly confined Planck's formula to the field of blackbody radiation, ignoring the universality of the micro mass-energy relationship it revealed. This limited perception persisted for a considerable time. It wasn't until Einstein proposed the photoelectric effect explanation that the potential of Planck's formula was partially unleashed. Yet its complete physical meaning remained buried in the dust of history.

## The Obscured Micro Mass-Energy Relationship

Planck's formula `E = hν` essentially established an energy scale for the microscopic world. Through Planck's constant `h`, a direct connection was established between physical reality and frequency `ν`. This connection not only applies to electromagnetic radiation but also predicts the fundamental characteristics of all microscopic particles. However, this profound insight remained inadequately recognized for a considerable period.

The concept of energy quantization was too advanced for its time, and the continuous thinking of classical physics hindered exploration of its deeper meaning. Physicists were content with using this formula to solve blackbody radiation problems, missing the important clues about the nature of matter contained within. This cognitive limitation only began to break with de Broglie's matter wave hypothesis.

## Deep Connection with Einstein's Equation

In 1905, Einstein's mass-energy equation `E = mc²` clearly revealed the equivalence between mass and energy. This formula established a framework for mass-energy unification at the macroscopic level, but its microscopic foundation was actually already embedded in Planck's formula. The combination of the two formulas, `ν = mc²/h`, provides a complete picture for understanding mass-energy relationships in the microscopic world.

Through this relationship, the characteristic frequency of mass quanta can be derived from their rest mass. Electrons appear in the energy spectrum with a characteristic frequency of `1.24×10²⁰` Hertz, while top quarks reach the high-frequency region of `4.19×10²⁵` Hertz. These precise numerical relationships indicate that Planck's formula applies not only to massless energy quanta but also to massive mass quanta.

## Complete Picture of the Frequency Spectrum

Based on the micro mass-energy relationship of Planck's formula, elementary particles exhibit clear frequency distribution patterns. In the low-frequency region below `10²⁰` Hertz, energy quanta dominate. This region includes the broad spectrum of photons and the characteristic frequency range of gravitons, exhibiting long wavelength and large interaction range characteristics.

The transition region (`10²⁰`–`10²⁶` Hertz) presents a more complex physical picture. Fermions such as electrons and quarks distribute in the lower frequency bands of this region, while W bosons, Z bosons, and the Higgs boson concentrate in the high-frequency area around `10²⁵` Hertz. Particularly noteworthy is the special position of the Higgs boson at `3.02×10²⁵` Hertz, precisely corresponding to the energy scale of the mass-giving mechanism.

In the region above `10²⁶` Hertz, known particles from the Standard Model have not yet appeared. This vacant area suggests the possible existence of new physical laws and heavier elementary particles.

## Crucial Role of the Higgs Mechanism

The special position of the Higgs boson in the frequency spectrum reveals its core role in the mass-energy unification process. Through the Higgs mechanism, originally massless particles acquire mass, achieving the transition from energy quanta to mass quanta. This process not only explains the origin of mass quanta but, more importantly, establishes a clear connection between energy and mass.

W and Z bosons serve as typical examples of this transformation process. They acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, enabling them to exist stably within specific frequency ranges. The existence of the Higgs field provides a solid physical foundation for the combination of Planck's formula and Einstein's equation, offering a complete theoretical framework for understanding mass-energy unification.

## The Crossroads of Quantum Mechanics

Contemporary quantum mechanics stands at a developmental crossroads. Although complex mathematical formalisms have achieved great success, they have gradually distanced physicists from the phenomenon-driven research tradition. The trend toward mathematization in theoretical physics has, to some extent, obscured the essence of physical phenomena, causing people to neglect profound physical truths like Planck's formula.

The proposal of Energy Quanta Theory (EQT) aims to return to the origins of physics. By establishing a theoretical framework centered on Planck's formula, EQT attempts to restore the clarity of physical imagery while maintaining mathematical rigor. This return to phenomenon-driven research methods may open new paths for the development of theoretical physics.

## Framework and Significance of Energy Quanta Theory

Energy Quanta Theory establishes a particle classification system based on physical essence. In this theory, elementary particles are divided into two major categories: energy quanta and mass quanta. Energy quanta include photons, gluons, and hypothetical gravitons—they have no rest mass and propagate at light speed. Mass quanta include particles with rest mass such as electrons, quarks, W/Z bosons, and the Higgs boson.

This classification method transcends the traditional boson-fermion division based on spin statistics, more directly reflecting the essential physical characteristics of particles. Through the combination of Planck's formula and Einstein's equation, Energy Quanta Theory achieves a unified description of the microscopic and macroscopic worlds.

## Future Development Directions

Energy Quanta Theory points to new directions for physics development. First, this theoretical framework is expected to naturally incorporate gravity into the quantum system. Gravitons, as hypothetical energy quanta, with their low-frequency characteristics and infinite interaction range consistent with theoretical predictions, provide new ideas for the development of quantum gravity theory.

Second, Energy Quanta Theory's focus on high-frequency vacant regions will promote new explorations in experimental physics. Future high-energy physics experiments may pay more attention to specific frequency regions, where new physical phenomena beyond the Standard Model may be hidden.

## Conclusion

The micro mass-energy relationship contained in Planck's formula took a long time to be rediscovered. This neglected truth not only reveals the deep unity of nature but also provides new perspectives for understanding the essence of the quantum world. By returning to the origin of Planck's formula, Energy Quanta Theory establishes a concise yet profound theoretical framework. Within this framework, the boundaries between energy and mass, micro and macro, quantum and classical become blurred, replaced by a unified, harmonious picture of nature.

As research deepens, this theoretical framework may achieve its initial goal: establishing a theoretical system centered on Planck's formula that can uniformly describe all physical phenomena. This is not only the pursuit of theoretical physics but also humanity's unremitting exploration to understand the essence of nature.
